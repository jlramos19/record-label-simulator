# Pending Concepts

This file tracks referenced concepts that need canon definition. It is separate from contradictions.

## Open Items
- UI neutral palette: exact hex values for the neutral dark-brown baseline and depth steps, constrained to the hex-step grid (00/33/66/99/CC/FF).
- Mood motif set completeness: confirm the full motif icon set and any rules for fallback/placeholder usage (see docs/CONTRADICTIONS.md entry 2025-12-24-doc-sync-01).
- Colored-heart overlays: define the exact heart set and where it is allowed to appear (alignment overlay only).
- Auto-rollout conditions: define the exact rules a player can set for idle/automatic rollout execution (eligibility checks, gating thresholds, and stop conditions).
- Country transaction model mapping: identify which Gaia country corresponds to Country A/B/C in Economy - Country Transaction Models.

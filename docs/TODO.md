# TODO

- [ ] RLS-TIME-001: Define weekly timing (release processing Fri 00:00, trends Fri 12:00, charts weekly at non-Fri-00:00 time) and align schedule triggers + UI countdowns.
- [ ] RLS-TRENDS-001: Define trend ledger + rolling 28-day window, implement weekly refresh, and wire chart trend inputs.
- [ ] RLS-UI-TRENDS-001: Align all non-community trend surfaces to the same weekly trend ranking (header + create view).
- [ ] Update chart metrics to use regional consumption weights and refresh chart documentation.
- [ ] CCC signing: deduct cash only on successful creator sign; failed attempts gray out the sign button until the daily refresh; document creator acceptance criteria.

Note: Items stay here until you confirm they are fulfilled.

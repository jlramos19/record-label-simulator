# TODO

- [ ] RLS-PROMO-AUTO-001: Define auto promo wallet-percentage budgeting for player + rivals and document the rule.
- [ ] RLS-DOC-PATCH-001: Cross-link new docs, update testing checklist, and add consolidated patch note summary.
- [ ] Update chart metrics to use regional consumption weights and refresh chart documentation.
- [ ] RLS-UI-ACTIONS-001: Specify the Music Executive action buttons surface (panel/section), button copy, and status behavior (Live vs Simulated vs Placeholder).
- [ ] RLS-UI-ACTIONS-002: Create an action registry mapping verbs -> route/panel target + tooltip + status; align with `ROLE_ACTIONS` in `src/app/game.ts`.
- [ ] RLS-UI-ACTIONS-003: Render Music Executive action buttons with status badges and disabled states for simulated/placeholder actions.
- [ ] RLS-UI-ACTIONS-004: Wire live action buttons to navigation + focus behavior (CCC sign, Harmony Hub form, slot placement, Release Desk scheduling, Era Desk conduct, Calendar tours) and log UI events.
- [ ] RLS-UI-ACTIONS-005: Add a "not live yet" modal or toast for simulated/placeholder actions with the current behavior note (ex: negotiate auto-resolves on sign).

Note: Items stay here until you confirm they are fulfilled.

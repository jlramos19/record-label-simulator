# Decision Register

This register is the canonical list of governance decisions for Record Label Simulator.
Decision IDs follow the format `DEC-YYYYMMDD-###`.

## Governance
- DEC-20251225-001: Canon rules live in GitHub `docs/`; Google Drive mirrors GitHub and is not canon; conflicts are resolved case-by-case with GitHub as the tie-breaker.

## Retcon policy
- DEC-20251225-002: Unity-era content is retconned into web equivalents; concepts stay intact while Unity-specific wording and tooling are rewritten.

## Debug and inspection policy
- DEC-20251225-003: Debugging uses a minimum in-app inspection concept plus deeper browser console tooling; a dedicated Simulation Inspector UI is postponed (nice-to-have).

## Closure workflow
- DEC-20251225-004: Closure workflow is TODO -> Docs -> Code -> Patch Notes.

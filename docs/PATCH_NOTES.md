# Patch Notes

## 2025-12-25
- Canon governance established: `docs/` is canon and GitHub is the tie-breaker; Drive mirrors GitHub.
- Unity retcon policy established for Unity-era content and terminology.
- Contradiction closure workflow defined (TODO -> Docs -> Code -> Patch Notes).
- Agent instructions standardized (`AGENTS.md` and updated Copilot instructions).
- Weekly cadence now separates release processing (Fri 00:00), trend refresh (Fri 12:00), and charts update (Sat 00:00).

# Patch Notes

## 2025-12-25
- Canon governance established: `docs/` is canon and GitHub is the tie-breaker; Drive mirrors GitHub.
- Unity retcon policy established for Unity-era content and terminology.
- Contradiction closure workflow defined (TODO -> Docs -> Code -> Patch Notes).
- Agent instructions standardized (`AGENTS.md` and updated Copilot instructions).
- Weekly cadence now separates release processing (Fri 00:00), trend refresh (Fri 12:00), and charts update (Sat 00:00).
- Trends now refresh weekly from a rolling 28-day ledger and feed a unified ranking across non-community surfaces.
- Top Trends summary now lives in the header as a top-3 list alongside Top Labels.
- Community tab now shows up to Top 40 global trends filtered by rolling-window consumption and recent chart presence.
- CCC signing now deducts cash only on success; rejected attempts lock the Sign button until the next 12AM refresh; precondition failures do not lock out; CCC signing docs added.
- Broadcast Studios now gate interviews and live performances with day-based slot availability (Sunday-heavy).
- Filming Studio slots now gate music videos and eyeriSocial ads; ads cost more and post as multimedia promos.
- Promotions tab now supports multi-select promo types and houses the eyeriSocial feed (renamed from the Social tab).
- Auto promo now spends a wallet-percentage budget (default 5%) per promo type for both player and rival labels.
- Summary: weekly timing split (release/trends/charts), rolling trends with global/community views, and new promo facilities (broadcast/filming + ads).

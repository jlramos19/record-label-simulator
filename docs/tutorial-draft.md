# Tutorial Draft - Friend-to-Friend Guide (Beginner)

This draft is written like we are explaining the game to a friend. It assumes zero record label or music knowledge and sticks to how the web MVP actually works.

Loop in one sentence: sign creators, form an act, build a track, release it, promote it, then watch charts move.

## How to use this guide
- If you want fast: read "Fast Start (2 minutes)" and stop.
- If you want full: read "Full Walkthrough (comprehensive)."
- If you want smoother grind: read "Auto Mode (smoother grind)."

## Friendly opener (use this as the first tutorial line)
Hey, congrats on your new record label. In this game, a "label" is a tiny factory that turns a few talented people into songs and then turns songs into money and charts. In real life it is messier, but ahem, the game keeps it tidy so we can have fun.

## Quick glossary (plain English)
- Creator ID: a person card you can hire. Think "staff member."
- Act: the artist or group the public sees (a solo artist or a group).
- Track: one song.
- Project: a release bundle (Single, EP, Album). Not a project management tool.
- Era: a campaign window for one Act. The game groups releases into Eras.
- CCC: the creator hiring market (Community -> CCC).
- Harmony Hub: where you form Acts (Signed -> Harmony Hub).
- Create: the production pipeline (Sheet -> Demo -> Master).
- Calendar/Release Desk: where releases and promos get scheduled.
- Promotions/eyeriSocial: the marketing and social feed.
- Wallet: your cashflow. The "do not go broke" meter.

## Accessibility-first tips (fast wins)
- Pause time while you learn. Nothing breaks.
- Hover disabled buttons to read the exact reason.
- Use the Panels menu to hide clutter.
- Quick Recipes in the Tutorial modal gives ready-made loops.
- Auto Create and Auto Promo reduce clicking when you want a smoother, grindier ride.

## Fast Start (2 minutes)
1) Pick a save slot in the main menu
   - Defaults: Modern Mode (2400), Medium difficulty, Fast time, auto-save every 2 minutes.

2) Sign Creator IDs (Community -> CCC)
   - Hire at least one Songwriter, Recorder, and Producer.
   - Signing is instant: accept or reject right away.
   - Rejections do not take your money, but the Creator locks until the next 12AM CCC refresh.

3) Form an Act (Signed -> Harmony Hub)
   - Solo = 1 person, Group = 2-3 people.
   - Quick Act is the fast option and avoids duplicate lineups.

4) Make a track (Create view)
   - Sheet -> Demo -> Master.
   - Pick Theme and Mood, then assign the right roles.
   - You need open studio slots for each stage.

5) Schedule a release (Releases -> Calendar/Release Desk)
   - Release ASAP goes to the next Friday 00:00.
   - Digital is fast, Physical or Both pays more.

6) Promote it (Promotions -> eyeriSocial)
   - Pick an Act, then optionally a Project or Track.
   - Set promo budgets (total spend is the sum of selected promo cards).

7) Run time and check results
   - Weekly cadence (in-game UTC):
     - Friday 00:00: releases process
     - Friday 12:00: trends refresh
     - Saturday 00:00: charts update

## Auto Mode (smoother grind)
Auto mode exists for the players who want an easier, smoother, grindier experience.

- Auto Create builds tracks for you on the weekly cadence, using your budget and cash reserve rules.
- Auto Promo spends from your chosen budget split and keeps promotions rolling.
- You still schedule releases, but the busywork drops a lot.
- If Auto Create or Auto Promo cannot run, the UI tells you why (budget, slots, or missing targets).

## Full Walkthrough (comprehensive)

### 1) Start with time paused
- Hit Pause so the clock does not sprint while you learn the UI.

### 2) Pick a save slot and preferences (Main Menu)
- Choose a game slot, mode, and difficulty.
- Starting Theme/Mood preferences are prefilled; you can reroll them if you want.
- Cheater Mode unlocks economy tuning in the Tutorial, but disables achievements and tasks while active.

### 3) Sign Creator IDs (Community -> CCC)
- Use filters to find roles (Songwriter, Recorder, Producer).
- Signing cost pulls from your Wallet.
- Acceptance depends on label Themes/Moods, creator skill, and market heat (ahem, humans are not vending machines in real life).
- Rejections do not deduct cash, but that Creator is locked until the next 12AM refresh.

### 4) Form an Act (Signed -> Harmony Hub)
- A Solo Act uses 1 creator; a Group Act uses 2-3 unique creators.
- Each creator can be in up to 4 Acts at a time.
- Quick Act is the fast button when you just need a playable roster.

### 5) Create a track (Create view)
You build tracks in three stages:
- Sheet: assign a Songwriter, pick Theme and Mood.
  - Modifiers are consumable and apply here.
- Demo: assign a Recorder; Mood must be set by now.
- Master: assign a Producer and set Alignment.

Common blockers:
- No studio slots open for that stage.
- Missing a required role or ID is busy.
- Not enough cash for the stage cost.
- Track is not ready for the next stage.

### 6) Release it (Releases -> Calendar/Release Desk)
- Release ASAP schedules to the next Friday 00:00 window.
- Project track counts:
  - Single: 1-4 tracks
  - EP: 5-7 tracks
  - Album: 8-32 tracks
- Projects are release containers, not tracks.
- Eras group releases within a 26-week gap window, so steady cadence matters.

### 7) Promote it (Promotions -> eyeriSocial)
- Pick an Act, then optionally a Project or Track.
- Choose promo types and budgets; total spend is the sum of selected promo cards.
- Some promos need facilities (broadcast or filming studios).
- Scheduled promos appear in the Calendar.

### 8) Run time (Time controls)
- Pause, Play, or Fast control the sim speed.
- Skip Time lets you jump days or months when you are waiting on results.
- Weekly cadence (in-game UTC):
  - Friday 00:00: releases process
  - Friday 12:00: trends refresh
  - Saturday 00:00: charts update

### 9) Read results (Charts, Dashboard, World)
- Charts show how your tracks and projects are performing.
- Dashboard tracks CEO Requests (achievements) and momentum.
- World view shows market data, economy summaries, population, and rivals.

### 10) Keep the Wallet healthy
- Use Wallet to track weekly revenue and upkeep.
- Negative cash means fewer options and blocked actions.

### 11) Inventory rules (Modifiers vs Tools vs Skills)
- Modifiers are consumable production boosts applied on sheet creation.
- Tools are permanent preference tweaks (Theme, Mood, Alignment, Genre).
  - A preference tool only applies if it changes a non-matching slot.
  - If it cannot apply, it is not consumed.
  - When it applies, it replaces a non-matching slot and avoids duplicates.
- Skills are creator-intrinsic and improve with completed work.
- If an item needs both a preference tweak and a production boost, keep them as separate Tool + Modifier entries.

### 12) Training wheels (optional, but nice)
- Quick Recipes in the Tutorial modal gives ready-made loops.
- Auto Assign and Recommend All fill slots quickly.
- Auto Create and Auto Promo reduce grind once you trust them.

## Closing script (wrap-up)
That is the loop: hire people, build a track, release it, promote it, and let time roll. If anything feels weird, it probably has a tooltip or a log explaining why. And yes, ahem, real labels do not ship songs in three buttons, but in this game we do because it is fun and we like charts.

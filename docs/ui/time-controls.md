# Time Controls

The header time controls drive simulation pacing and quick skips.

## Buttons
- Pause (stopped), Play (1h = 2.5s), Fast (1h = 1s): set time speed with real-time ratios shown in the label.
- Auto Day: quick-skip 24 hours using the loading-bar time jump flow.
- Auto Week: quick-skip 7 days using the loading-bar time jump flow.
- Skip (custom): opens the time skip modal with quick presets (24h, 7d, 14d, 28d, 3 months, 6 months), plus custom days/hours and skip-to-date.
- Auto Day/Week and custom skips share the same progress modal and chunked time advance.
- Skip Time logs a completion summary with rival AutoOps blockers and release counts.

# Time Controls

The header time controls drive simulation pacing and quick skips.

## Buttons
- Pause (stopped), Play (1h = 2.5s), Fast (1h = 1s): set time speed with real-time ratios shown in the label.
- Auto Day (24h = 12s): toggles auto-skipping one day every 12 seconds.
- Auto Week (7d = 7s): toggles auto-skipping one week every 7 seconds.
- Skip (custom): opens the custom time skip modal.
- Only one time control can be active at once; auto-skips pause manual speed, and manual speed stops auto-skips.

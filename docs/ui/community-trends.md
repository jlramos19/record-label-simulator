# Community Trends (World View)

The Community (world) view is the canonical place to browse the global Top Trends list.

## Display rules
- Scope: Global only.
- Ranking size toggle: Top 8 or Top 40 (shared with labels).
- "More" on #1 opens the full list (all available trends).
- Update timing: Friday 12:00 (trend refresh time).

## Filtering rules
Trends must satisfy both:
- Consumption > 0 in the rolling 28-day window.
- Chart presence in the last 4 chart weeks (appears at least once in global chart entries).

## Notes
- This view reflects the same weekly trend ledger defined in `docs/systems/trends/trends-cadence.md`.

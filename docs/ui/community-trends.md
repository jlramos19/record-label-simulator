# Community Trends (Header Window)

The header Top Trends list is the canonical entry point for global trend rankings.

## Display rules
- Scope: Global only.
- Header shows the Top 3 trends as a preview.
- "More" opens a draggable, scrollable floating window with the Top 40 list.
- Update timing: Friday 12:00 (trend refresh time).

## Filtering rules
Trends must satisfy both:
- Consumption > 0 in the rolling 28-day window.
- Chart presence in the last 4 chart weeks (appears at least once in global chart entries).

## Notes
- This view reflects the same weekly trend ledger defined in `docs/systems/trends/trends-cadence.md`.
- The world view no longer includes a Top Trends panel.

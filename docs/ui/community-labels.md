# Community Labels (Header Window)

The header Top Labels list is the canonical entry point for global label rankings.

## Display rules
- Ranking source: global chart points.
- Header shows the Top 3 labels as a preview.
- "More" opens a draggable, scrollable floating window with the Top 8 list.
- The floating window includes a Top Theme / Mood column per label, based on released track usage.
- All known labels remain listed even at 0 points, surfacing as Inactive or Bankrupted.
- Each label row includes a "Since" date (first in-game release, fallback to game start).
- Rival label pills are clickable and jump to the Community view with the Rival Rosters panel focused on that label.

## Notes
- The world view no longer includes a Top Labels panel.
- Rival rosters live in the Community view as a selectable panel (creators + observed acts per label).

# Eras Tracks Panel

This doc defines the chart history surface inside the Tracks panel on the Eras view.

## Scope
- Adds a "History" tab in the Tracks panel on the Eras route.
- Shows chart positions per week per chart for released tracks tied to the focused era (or the only active era).
- Uses DNC for released tracks that did not chart that week; "-" for weeks before release.
- Pulls data from stored weekly chart snapshots.

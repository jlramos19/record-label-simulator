# Act Formation

Defines rules for forming Acts in the roster (Harmony Hub).

## Act types
- Solo Act: one creator.
- Group Act: two or three unique creators.

## Member limits
- A creator can belong to up to 4 unique Acts at a time.
- Creators at the limit cannot join additional Acts until they leave an Act.

## Quick Act
- Chooses Solo or Group at random.
- Group size is 2-3 when enough eligible creators are available.
- Uses only creators below the act membership limit; if none are eligible, Quick Act warns and stops.

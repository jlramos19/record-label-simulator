# Win/Loss Rules (Web MVP)

## Victory Paths
- Before Year 3000: complete the 12 CEO Requests (annual award wins; see `annual-awards.md`) without triggering a monopoly loss.
- Year 3000-3999: complete the 12 CEO Requests (annual award wins) to secure a win state.
- Year 4000: final verdict uses current or cumulative #1 label status if no loss has occurred.

## Loss Conditions
- Bankruptcy after declining or exhausting a bailout.
- Monopoly rule: if any single label occupies every slot on any chart (tracks, promotions, or tours) at any scope (global, nation, or region), the game ends immediately in a loss.
- Rival race: if any rival label completes all 12 CEO Requests before the player has secured a win state, the game ends in a loss.

## Tracking
- Win/loss checks run during weekly updates and after annual awards resolve.
- Rival CEO Request completion is evaluated from the same annual awards ledger and compared against the 12-request target.

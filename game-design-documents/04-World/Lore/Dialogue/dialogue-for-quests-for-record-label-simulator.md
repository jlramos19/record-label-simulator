`Title: First Date`  
`Planning the Date`  
`In the bustling capital city of Bloomville, as December unfolded and the city adorned itself in festive lights, Marc and Genevive found themselves on the cusp of an unforgettable moment. It all began when Genevive, on December 13th, wished Marc a heartfelt "Happy Birthday." Her warm words ignited a spark, setting their first date into motion.`  
`Late one evening, as the stars began to twinkle above the city, Marc initiated the conversation. "Genevive," he began nervously, "I've been thinking. How about we go on a date? Just you and me."`  
`Genevive's heart raced as a smile crossed her face. "I'd love that, Marc," she replied, her voice tinged with happiness. They dove into the details of their upcoming adventure, discussing where to meet, what to wear, and the perfect place for their rendezvous.`  
`Discovering a Shared Favorite`  
`As they continued planning, they discovered something remarkable - they both had the same favorite restaurant in Bloomville, a charming place adorned with flowers and greens, where every table was a secluded haven of tranquility. It was a delightful revelation that made their connection feel even more serendipitous.`  
`The Menu Dilemma`  
`Once they arrived at the restaurant, the atmosphere was as enchanting as they had hoped. Soft candlelight bathed the cozy space in a warm glow. Marc and Genevive were seated at a quiet corner table, menus in hand, their eyes sparkling with anticipation.`  
`As they perused the menu, Marc's gaze settled on a dish he had always enjoyed. With a hint of excitement, he pointed to it and said, "I think I'll have the [dish name], it's always been my favorite."`  
`Genevive's reaction was unexpected. She glanced at the menu item he had chosen and muttered, "Oh, gross."`  
`Marc's smile waned, replaced by a momentary flash of embarrassment. He tried to recover, stammering, "I can order something else if you'd prefer."`  
`Genevive hesitated, realizing the impact of her words, but her pride held her back from apologizing. Instead, she remained silent.`  
`The tension lingered in the air as Marc contemplated his choice. In the end, he decided to order something different, despite secretly still craving the dish he had originally chosen.`  
`Dining at the Charming Restaurant`  
`Their dinner continued with small talk and laughter, but beneath the surface, a subtle shift had occurred. They discussed their lives, shared dreams, and passions, but the menu incident left an indelible mark on their evening.`  
`The atmosphere remained serene, the restaurant's ambiance a perfect backdrop for a budding romance. However, the unspoken tension between them added complexity to the night.`  
`The night of their date took place somewhere between the 14th and 31st of December, just after Genevive's heartfelt birthday wish on December 13th.`  
`As they enjoyed their meal and each other's company, they got lost in conversation, forgetting the world around them. In the midst of laughter and connection, they completely overlooked one crucial detail - asking for the bill.`  
`It wasn't until the waitress approached them with a knowing smile that they realized their oversight. Marc's face flushed with embarrassment as he admitted, "I forgot to ask for the bill." Genevive chuckled and agreed, and all three of them shared a hearty laugh together.`  
`Late-Night Conversations on eyeriSocial`  
`Their laughter continued as they left the restaurant, walking together to catch the free public transportation. Even after they parted ways and returned to their respective parents' homes, they couldn't resist continuing their conversation.`  
`Late into the night, they logged onto eyeriSocial, a remarkable device that allowed them to communicate through eye contacts, a fusion of technology and intimacy. With their hearts still connected, they talked, laughed, and shared their thoughts, making promises for a future filled with unforgettable moments.`

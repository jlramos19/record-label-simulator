# **`Concept`**

## **`Angering Loyalty`**

`Angering Loyalty is RAW VOW’s fan-engagement philosophy: devotion that grows stronger through controlled tension. The act strategically keeps the audience mobilized using rivalry framing, selective access, and emotionally confrontational writing.`

`Typical activation patterns:`

`• “Prove them wrong” narratives (the act as perpetually underestimated).`

`• Scarcity tactics (tight windows, selective access, limited drops).`

`• Rivalry energy (competition moments that push fans to act).`

## **`Record Label Simulator Canon Update: Archived Content Terminology`**

### **`Scope`**

`This document defines canonical terminology for content that is no longer active in the gameplay loop.`

### **`Canon term`**

`Use Archived content as the umbrella term for any content that is no longer active in the main loop.`

### **`Required phrasing`**

`When referring to archived items, always specify the content category:`

* `Archived main content`

* `Archived promotional content`

### **`Usage rules`**

* `Use Archived content (and its category variants) for content lifecycle state.`

* `Do not use “Legacy” to describe content lifecycle state. “Legacy” remains reserved for the Era stage only.`

### **`Consistency note`**

`If older docs say “legacy performance” (for content lifecycle), update that wording to archived performance or otherwise rephrase to reflect Archived content.`

`Blue - song lyrics track`

`Why?`  
`Why did you have to wait so long?`  
`Now I have to write you this song`  
`It doesn’t matter cause you’re gone`

`My…`  
`Heart couldn’t take it anymore`  
`I felt you walking through the door`  
`Is it cause you finally got bored?`

`Lie!`  
`Do it again, I won’t ignore`  
`The way you do it to get more`  
`you know you’re still who I adore`

`I just can’t… see you look at me`   
`And not feel that thing`   
`That thing that we felt when things were good, things were great, yeah so great`

`I might’ve been dreaming`   
`My glasses are off`  
`I see that you’re speeding`  
`Or you just shut off`

`Can you talk to me, please?`  
`Let’s work it through`   
`I can’t see you like this`   
`What do I have to prove?`

`Just seems like`  
`Nothing I say sounds right`   
`Just seems like`   
`This is our last goodbye`

`You’re not joking`  
`You’re not looking`   
`…at me`

`as you say`  
`That you don’t`   
`Want me more`

`You don’t say it that way`  
`But I can see you stray`  
`I read between the lines`   
`While you send all the signs`

`I know you’re tired`  
`I’m tired too`  
`But I desired`  
`For us two`

`To be together`   
`and last forever` 

`But we don’t feel the same`   
`At least not anymore`   
`Did we do this in vain?`  
`Or were you keeping score?`

`Can I tell you a secret?`  
`I got resentful too`  
`When you told me you’d be there`  
`But now I just feel… blue`

`I wish you were able to tell me what’s wrong`  
`It might just be too late`   
`I can’t process the fact that we’re done`   
`it makes me feel so lame` 

`I feel butterflies in my stomach`   
`I wish they were all dead`  
`Cause I don’t know how I can stomach`  
`Hearing you lie in my bed` 

`And I just wonder`  
`Why did we do that?`  
`I’d have to ponder`  
`Was I too fat?`

`I’m so fucking sad`  
`Frustrated even`  
`I want you so bad`  
`But what’s the reason?`

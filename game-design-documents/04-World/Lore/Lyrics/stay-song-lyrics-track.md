  
`[Verse]`  
`You wouldn't believe`  
`The weird things I see`  
`Just roll up your sleeves`  
`And don't scare the bees`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`This house is haunted`  
`It's been like this a while now`  
`We could've hunted`  
`But outside it's so dark right now`

`[Chorus]`  
`Stay inside, stay inside`  
`You don't wanna go out`  
`Trust me it's suicide`  
`They're waiting to devour`

`Stay right here, stay right here`  
`If you want, do come near`  
`Believe me, they will kill`  
`You in under an hour`

`[Bridge]`  
`I've barely survived`  
`In these conditions`  
`You wouldn't survive`  
`In these conditions`

`I said they'll devour`  
`You like a mission`  
`You think you know power`  
`But you need reason`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`This house is haunted`  
`It's been like this a while now`  
`We could've hunted`  
`But outside it's so dark right now`

`[Chorus]`  
`Stay inside, stay inside`  
`You don't wanna go out`  
`Trust me it's suicide`  
`They're waiting to devour`

`Stay right here, stay right here`  
`If you want, do come near`  
`Believe me, they will kill`  
`You in under an hour`

`[Outro]`  
`Stay in place, stay in place`  
`They can tell you're ter ror ized.`

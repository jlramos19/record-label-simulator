Hate is a reflection of our desires  
When we hate, it’s because we loved

When we allow ourselves to understand why we feel the way we do, we unlock the reason why we have certain drives. 

When we feel like we need something, we often look for FREEDOM to feel whole. We like to do this by feeling certain emotions. They change from person to person, every one of us is full of complex emotions, for the sake of simplicity, let’s enclose them into seven main categories: HAPPY, SURPRISED, SAD, ANGRY, DISGUSTED and UNEASY. Wait, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… I’m missing one. Oh, I know: FEAR. 

We often forget that fear is an emotion, and we often fail to understand that we are scared, and that’s why we do certain things most of the time. 

Another drive we have is that of seeking LOYALTY, we are driven to seek love by nature, it’s something we as humans crave and actively search for. Whether it be for another human, an animal or pet, a thing or idea, we all inherently love, even when we hate, we’re loving. 

In order for us to achieve our goals of feeling fulfilled and in love or loved, we must use certain resources at our disposal to achieve said goals. This is done by having a drive for AMBITION. Ambition is that force that pushes us to fearlessly chase that thing or person we so badly desire in our presence. 

But we mustn’t forget to chase our goals without first having a drive for MORALITY, striving to maintain a respectful boundary between you and the space around you is of utmost importance. By showing respect for the things we love, we are being a moral person. And remember, even the things we think we hate, in reality we love, so we are respectful toward everyone and everything. 

If we succeed at our mission of finding FREEDOM, gaining LOYALTY, chasing AMBITION and having MORALITY, we unlock the sense of POWER. We all love to feel in control, even when we think we’re giving control to other people or things, in reality we’re choosing the player, and telling them “play me”. Keep that in mind when you obtain POWER. 

When reaching the top of the charts, think of the things you wanted before you reached your goal, and now, go on and do that thing. 

(When the top of the charts are reached in-game, the CEO gains a temporary bonus where all of his five drives are at max, which means he can create whatever era he wants next, which is an opportunity to ride off the popularity of the previous era to change the current trend.)

I don’t know where to start  
I have so much to say  
I have so many scars  
It feels like yesterday  
When I was in your car  
With so much love to spare  
But now it seems so hard  
Just to look at your face

You’re not here anymore  
But I don’t give up on you  
You told me you were bored  
Well, I’ll say I was bored too

It seems  
Like the only experience that matters is your own  
It feels  
Like the decent moments that we shared were all so wrong 

Did you ever truly love me?  
I sit down here and wonder   
No matter how much you say it  
If you don’t help me believe it

They say actions speak louder than words  
I was deaf and blind seeking your love  
And somehow it makes me want you more  
I would’ve preferred for you to stay bored

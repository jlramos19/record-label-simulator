`[Verse]`  
`Autumn leaves filled the road`  
`I found it so romantic, you did not`  
`I found it so depressing, you would not`  
`Enjoy the scenery how I enjoyed it`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`You stopped the car`  
`When would you start?`  
`We looked directly at each other but no spark (I never thought in hell is where I’d find this bar)`  
`So when would you start?`

`[Chorus]`  
`You said we hurt each other`  
`And you hated your father`  
`For talking to your mother`  
`About the things he gathered`

`[Chorus]`  
`From what I told your brother`  
`‘Fore all of this got madder`  
`I wasn’t trying to bother`  
`Or complicate the matter`

`[Chorus]`  
`But you blamed me, didn’t stutter`  
`Ignored that I was sadder`

`[Post-chorus]`  
`You didn’t like the chatter`  
`Cause you felt so much smarter`  
`I tried to reach another`  
`You who would think I mattered`

`[Post-chorus]`  
`While lost in all the clutter`  
`I didn't mean to scatter`  
`Somehow then you looked hotter`  
`So I gave in to flatter`

`[Post-chorus]`  
`I felt like a backstabber`  
`And my delusions shattered`  
`Bad words at me you splattered`  
`I thought you said I mattered`

`[Male Voicemail Spoken Word]`  
`Believe me, if it wasn’t because I know nothing but this, and this isn’t even something I know yet… I wouldn’t be here. WE! …wouldn’t be here.` 

`[Verse]`  
`Mastering your ways was never gonna work for me`  
`I believe your face was better before I was here`  
`Don’t know if I aged you or if you just hate yourself`  
`Bring me more confusion cause I crave the endless games`

`[Chorus]`  
`And I have to be delusional, I know.`   
`And accept that I will lose so much with you.`   
`And I hate to become loose yet not enough.`   
`And I get that you will choose to still move on.`

`[Verse]`  
`After everything I’m still unable to catch up`   
`I’m adapting I try to grow up but can’t keep up`  
`You’re so numb and just indifferent I will never know`  
`How to learn a little something I was never taught`

`[Chorus]`  
`And I have to be delusional, I know.`  
`And accept that I will lose so much with you.`  
`And I hate to become loose yet not enough.`  
`And I get that you will choose to still move on.`

`[Bridge]`  
`Tell me if you think that this is normal`  
`Try to convince me I can ignore that`  
`Bend the rules just one more time do more of that`  
`I think you enjoy seeing me adapt-`

`[Chorus]`  
`And I have to be delusional, I know.`   
`And accept that I will lose so much with you.`   
`And I hate to become loose yet not enough.`   
`And I get that you will choose to still move on.`

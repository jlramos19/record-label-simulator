`I don’t understand why you promise to do things and then don’t follow through with them`

`Tell me what you really wanna do, I’m here to try and get us through this`

`But I can’t keep fooling myself into thinking that you mean what you say`

`When the time comes, you act like you didn’t say what you said`

`It’s frustrating when you don’t want to let me express my emotions, because unlike you, I’m not a good actor`

`So as I try to pretend like everything’s okay, the truth is still plastered in my face and you notice it`

`So you give up on us when I’ve already convinced myself that this is okay and that I should endure it`

`Now all I have left is all the memories, good and bad`

`And I look back and think to myself “was it all worth it?”`

`And I still haven’t found the answer`

`This Time It’s Over`

`You make a promise to me`

`Though you know I don’t believe` 

`I don’t know what you want it to be`

`Cause you say one thing, and then do another`

`I’m tired of keeping the peace`

`Emotions through my face leak`

`The play is over and you’re still here`

`Though I want to speak, I don’t wanna bother` 

`But I can’t be like you`

`I can’t pretend well, I tell the truth like no other`

`And this is nothing new`

`We’re doing it again, but this time it’s over`

`Carta de Amor`

`[Verse]`  
`I just wanna feel that you’re mine`  
`I don’t wanna look in your eyes`   
`And recognize that you’re able to tell me lies`  
`I can’t process how you can lie`

`It’s so precise` 

`[Pre-chorus]`  
`My thoughts are clouded`  
`I’m raided by jealousy`  
`My mind so crowded`  
`You are the one fix I see`

`And you departed`  
`It’s weird cause I feel you here`  
`You’re so cold hearted`  
`I’m scared you’ll get up and leave`

`[Chorus]`  
`No supero tu carta de amor`  
`And I would hope not to try my luck`  
`And just keep trying to get you back`  
`I know it won’t work but I can’t stop`

`[Verse]`  
`I just wanna feel that you’re mine`  
`I just wanna look in your eyes`  
`And get hypnotized`

`[Bridge]`  
`That I swear`  
`I would idolize`  
`Your blue eyes`  
`I would idolize`

`It isn’t wise`

`[Pre-chorus]`  
`My thoughts are clouded`  
`I’m raided by jealousy`  
`My mind so crowded`  
`You are the one fix I see`

`And you departed`  
`It’s weird cause I feel you here`  
`You’re so cold hearted`  
`I’m scared you’ll get up and leave`

`[Chorus]`  
`No supero tu carta de amor`  
`And I would hope not to try my luck`  
`And just keep trying to get you back`  
`I know it won’t work but I can’t stop`

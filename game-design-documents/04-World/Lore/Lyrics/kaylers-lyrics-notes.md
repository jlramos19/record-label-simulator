Synth pop song  
Chord progression should descend, three repeated tunununs \*tununun, tununun, tununun, tununun\* (check voice notes)  
Lyrics about toxic friendship  
Inspired by and about: Skyler, Caleb and Keyla  
From the perspective of: Dawson, JL

Part of lyrics about how kayler blames me for what happens after following my “advice”, or if they don’t do it, I still have to hear about things going wrong   
The subject is second person: aka you   
The subject is also genderless

Lyrics should contain object borrowed and not returned  
Calling to vent and then hanging up after being done without asking how I am  
Trying to blame me for prioritizing my relationship  
Doing something awful and me not being able to hold you accountable because of the love I have for you

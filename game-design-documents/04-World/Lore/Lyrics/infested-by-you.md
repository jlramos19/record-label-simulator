`[Verse]`  
`Do you...`  
`Know just how to control my body?`

`Are you...`  
`Sure you've never been with nobody?`

`[One-liner]`  
`Did you really not like it when... We had our first kiss, way back when?`

`[Pre-chorus]`  
`It hurts to remember you now,`  
`My mind can't stop bringing you up,`  
`My art is infested by you,`  
`I like it, I can't change the truth!`

`[Chorus]`  
`I really tried to forget you,`  
`I even tried to regret you,`  
`Can't just remember forever,`  
`You as my muse is what's clever.`

`[Bridge]`  
`I can't be mad at you for doing to me what your dad taught you.`  
`But I expected you to still treat me like your mom raised you.`

`[Dirty Bass Electric Guitar Solo]`

`[Outro]`  
`Did you....`  
`Think I was your main adversary?`  
`Were you...`  
`Crazy when you said 'necessary'?`

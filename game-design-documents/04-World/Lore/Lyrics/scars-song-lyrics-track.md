You live with the scars  
Of our little cat  
And I wonder if you ever  
Look at them and remember how you got them

I live with the scars  
Of my brittle heart  
And I wonder if I ever  
Used a friend how you never thought you could’ve been 

When you led me on  
Once I was led on  
Maybe I was wrong  
But it’s been so long

So all I gotta say  
Is I hope you’re okay  
When you look at those scars  
Like I look at the stars

And remember when  
You were my only friend  
And I was so misguided  
My life was so divided

You told me that we tried  
All I see is that you lied  
Had only been six months  
Yet you said you moved on

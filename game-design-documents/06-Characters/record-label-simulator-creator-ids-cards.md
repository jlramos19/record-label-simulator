# `Record Label Simulator — Creator IDs (Cards)`

`In Record Label Simulator, Creators are represented in-game as Creator IDs (cards) owned by a Record Label. Creator IDs are placed into ID Slots in Structures to perform work and generate outputs.`

`Creator IDs are sourced from the Creators Community Chamber (CCC), which presents Creator IDs for Record Labels to sign.`

## `Canon model: Role → Occupation → Action Verb`

`A Creator is a Role. Each Creator ID can have one or more Creator Occupations, and each Occupation is defined by an Action verb.`

### `CREATOR (Role)`

#### `Songwriter (Occupation)`

- **`Action:`** `write`  
- **`Output:`** `creates Sheet Music (selecting Themes)`

#### `Vocalist (Occupation)`

- **`Action:`** `perform`  
- **`Output:`** `creates Demo Recordings (defining Moods)`

#### `Producer (Occupation)`

- **`Action:`** `produce`  
- **`Output:`** `creates Masters by combining Theme + Mood to assign content Genre and a preliminary Quality rating`

## `Currency and Wallet`

**`Currency`** `is the resource the Player uses to access and influence the Record Label’s Entities and Content.`

**`Wallet`** `refers to the Record Label’s current Currency balance (the spendable pool you allocate into creation, scheduling, and other actions).`

---

## `Scheduling and Calendar`

`Creator IDs have schedules because production work happens over time.`

`The Calendar is where the Music Executive (Player) schedules announcements and releases of Content. The calendar view should show how many Creator IDs are working at any given hour, and support sorting by name, age, and other parameters.`

---

## `Strategy`

`The strategy is managing:`

- `which Creator IDs you sign from the CCC`  
- `where you place Creator IDs (Structures + Slots)`  
- `how you allocate Currency (Wallet balance) across your creation pipeline`

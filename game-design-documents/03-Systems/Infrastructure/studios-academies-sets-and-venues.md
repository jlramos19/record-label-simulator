# Studios, Academies, Sets, and Venues

These are structure families that create, train, or amplify content. Each family uses slots to gate actions.

## Studios
- Recording studios: produce sheet, demo, and master stages.
- Filming studios: produce music videos and multimedia promo assets.
- Broadcast studios: produce interviews, live sets, and broadcast programs.

## Academies (roadmap)
- Train creator IDs to improve skills or unlock specialties.
- Use training slots and curriculum items as inputs.

## Sets (roadmap)
- Visual production spaces for photoshoots, cover art, and promo assets.
- Use crew slots and asset slots to run shoots.

## Venues (touring roadmap)
- Live performance spaces used by touring and special events.
- Use booking slots tied to dates, capacity tiers, and regional scope.

## Slot mechanics (shared)
- ID slots: assign creators or crew to a structure.
- Input slots: attach content items needed to start work.
- Booking slots: reserve facilities for a date window.
- Queue slots: optional "next up" staging to reduce micromanagement.

## Observability
- Slot blocks always show a reason (missing inputs, unavailable dates, or busy IDs).

# Area Slots

Area slots are attachment points on an area or structure that gate upgrades, permits, and special capabilities.

## Slot behavior
- Clicking a slot opens a picker showing allowed IDs or items.
- Locked items do not appear; unlocked-but-unowned items show disabled.
- Each slot shows eligibility rules and a reason when blocked.

## Slot types (examples)
- Permit slots: legal access to operate specific structures or events.
- Upgrade slots: equipment, staffing modules, or capacity boosts.
- Service slots: partnerships (security, logistics, marketing) that modify outcomes.

## Observability
- Slot blocks show reason codes and suggested fixes (missing item, missing cash, or missing prerequisite).

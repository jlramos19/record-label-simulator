## **Pre-Player Simulation Evolution (2025-2400)**

**Seeding rule (canon):**
- **2025-2200** is deterministic and identical across runs.
- **2200-2400** is uniquely seeded per run (variable).


### **Initial Stage (2025)**

* The simulation starts with 9 Communities corresponding to the 9 Moods that define content emotional tone.

* Each Community prefers Live Performances that mirror its Mood (example: Calming, Energizing, Saddening).

* At this stage, content creation is focused on Live Performances as the primary form of consumption.

### **Introduction of Themes and Writing (2025–2100)**

* As the simulation progresses, Themes are introduced to add narrative meaning to content.

* Songwriter IDs enter the simulation and create Sheet Music, assigning a Track’s Theme at the blueprint stage.

* Live performance culture remains important, but content begins accumulating structured metadata through Theme assignment.

### **Evolution to Distinct Music Genres (2025–2100)**

* Music Genres emerge as Theme \+ Mood combinations, expanding the world’s content vocabulary toward 45 total genres.

* Vocalist IDs create Demo Recordings to assign Mood.

* Producer IDs finalize the Track, refining Theme/Mood into a finalized content genre and Quality.

### **Full Diversification of Communities (2100)**

* The original 9 Mood Communities branch into 45 Communities aligned to Theme \+ Mood genres.

* The ecosystem expands beyond performances into broader content and promotion: Tracks, Projects, Interviews, Music Videos, and eyeriSocial activity.

* The simulation establishes the foundation needed for chart tracking and trend formation.

### **In-Game Charts History Period (2100–2200)**

* Music Charts run for a full historical archive window, cataloging genre success and trend cycles.

* This century of chart history becomes the strategic “history layer” the player can review later.

### **Final Pre-Player Build-Up (2200–2400)**

* Systems mature and stabilize: Audience preferences, Communities, Trends, and Content evaluation deepen over time.

* Critics and evaluation loops shape perceived quality and genre momentum.

* Acts solidify their fanbases and Alignment trajectories, creating a “fully-lived-in” industry state.

### **Player’s Start Date (2400)**

* The player enters a mature music industry with:

  * established Communities and preferences,

  * an existing Charts History archive,

  * stabilized systemic dynamics (Audience, Trends, Critics, Rival Labels).

* From here, the player’s decisions drive the future trajectory of Gaia’s music industry.

# **`In-Game Charts in Gaia`**

## **`1. Local/Regional Charts`**

`Each country has two local/regional charts: one for its capital city and one for everywhere outside the capital (labeled “Elsewhere”).`

### **`Annglora`**

* **`Bloomville Chart`** `(capital city)`  
* **`Elsewhere in Annglora`** `(all regions outside Bloomville)`

### **`Bytenza`**

* **`Belltown Chart`** `(capital city)`  
* **`Elsewhere in Bytenza`** `(all regions outside Belltown)`

### **`Crowlya`**

* **`Campana City Chart`** `(capital city)`  
* **`Elsewhere in Crowlya`** `(all regions outside Campana City)`

## **`2. National Charts`**

`Each of the three countries also tracks a national chart, aggregating performance from all regions (capital + elsewhere).`

* **`Annglora National Chart`**  
* **`Bytenza National Chart`**  
* **`Crowlya National Chart`**

## **`3. Gaia International Chart`**

`Finally, there is a single, worldwide chart that encompasses all of Gaia’s countries:`

* **`Gaia International Chart`**

`This serves as the ultimate metric for global success, combining data from every national chart and providing a definitive ranking of the most popular and critically acclaimed content across Annglora, Bytenza, and Crowlya.`

`Chart display rules:`

* `Global chart gating: The Gaia International Chart does not display until 100 ranked entries exist; until then, show a locked message (no partial list).`
* `Regional/National gaps: If a chart has fewer entries than its size, unfilled slots display as N/A placeholders.`

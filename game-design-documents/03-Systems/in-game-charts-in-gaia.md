`Below is a documentation-style overview of the in-game charts that exist in Gaia for Record Label Simulator. These charts measure content performance (tracks, projects, promotional content, tours) at local, national, and international levels.`

# **`In-Game Charts in Gaia`**

## **`Naming shorthand`**

`Chart naming can use place or scope depending on context:`

* `Global charts = Gaia charts or Global charts.`
* `National charts = nation name (ex: Annglora) or National charts.`
* `Regional charts = region name (ex: Bloomville) with a Regional suffix, or Regional charts.`

## **`1. Local/Regional Charts`**

`Each country has two local/regional charts: one for its capital city and one for everywhere outside the capital (labeled "Elsewhere").`

### **`Annglora`**

* **`Bloomville Regional Chart`** `(capital region)`  
* **`Annglora Elsewhere Regional Chart`** `(all regions outside Bloomville)`

### **`Bytenza`**

* **`Belltown Regional Chart`** `(capital region)`  
* **`Bytenza Elsewhere Regional Chart`** `(all regions outside Belltown)`

### **`Crowlya`**

* **`Campana City Regional Chart`** `(capital region)`  
* **`Crowlya Elsewhere Regional Chart`** `(all regions outside Campana City)`

## **`2. National Charts`**

`Each of the three countries also tracks a national chart, aggregating performance from all regions (capital + elsewhere).`

* **`Annglora National Chart`**  
* **`Bytenza National Chart`**  
* **`Crowlya National Chart`**

## **`3. Gaia Global Chart`**

`Finally, there is a single, worldwide chart that encompasses all of Gaia’s countries:`

* **`Gaia Global Chart`**

`This serves as the ultimate metric for global success, combining data from every national chart and providing a definitive ranking of the most popular and critically acclaimed content across Annglora, Bytenza, and Crowlya.`

`Chart display rules:`

* `Global chart gating: The Gaia Global Chart does not display until 100 ranked entries exist; until then, show a locked message (no partial list).`
* `Regional/National gaps: If a chart has fewer entries than its size, unfilled slots display as N/A placeholders.`

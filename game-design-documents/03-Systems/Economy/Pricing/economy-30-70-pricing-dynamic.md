### **`Economy - 30-70 Pricing Dynamic (Legacy)`**

`The 30-70 pricing pattern is a legacy design target and is not active in the web MVP.`

## **`If Revisited`**

* `Apply to the canonical project limits: Single (1-4), EP (5-7), Album (8-32).`
* `Use the digital single base price ($0.69) as the starting point.`
* `Alternate price increments using the 0.30 / 0.70 pattern stored in PRICE_PATTERN.`

`For current MVP pricing, refer to economy-pricing-and-track-limits-by-format.md.`

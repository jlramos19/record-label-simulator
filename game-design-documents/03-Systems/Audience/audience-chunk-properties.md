# **`Properties of Audience Chunks`**

`Here are the properties for audience chunks in the Record Label Simulator:`

1. **`Location`**`: The country where the audience chunk currently is. It decides which country's music charts are impacted when they listen to or buy music.`

2. **`Age Group`**`: Places each audience into age groups of 4-year cycles, like 16-19, 20-23, and so on. Only groups aged between 16 and 40 can have kids, which means they can create new audience chunks. Ages are seeded from the current population age pyramid per nation and skew younger, with 0-20 remaining eligible.`

3. **`Generation`**`: A 16-year period that groups the audience chunk, affecting what music they've grown up with and still enjoy.`

4. **`Budget`**`: The amount of money the audience chunk spends on music every week. For example, it could be $400. The players can't see this number, which can go up or down every four years as the audience chunk gets older.`

5. **`Engagement Rate`**`: How likely the audience chunk is to react to advertisements or promotions. This happens only during times when they're free and is a secret from the players.`

6. **`Time Available`**`: How much time in a week the audience chunk has to do music-related things—like going to concerts, watching music shows on TV, or listening to the radio—laid out in an hourly schedule.`

7. **`Life Expectancy`**`: The typical number of years the audience chunk is expected to live, provided within a 4-year bracket, which gives an idea of for how long they will buy and listen to music.`

8. **`Reproduction Rate`**`: How often the audience chunk can create new chunks (like having kids) that carry on their music tastes. The number ranges from 0 (no chance) to 4 (four times maximum).`

`This property indicates the potential for existing Audience Chunks to produce new Chunks. The new Chunks inherit the seven initial preferences from their 'parent' Chunk—a set of four preferred content genres, two preferred moods, and two preferred themes. However, when a new Chunk is 'born,' it randomly changes one preference from each category—resulting in a new Chunk with one of the preferred content genres, one of the preferred moods, and one of the preferred themes replaced. For instance, if an original Audience Chunk has the preferred content genres of bachata, pop, and R&B, and the preferred moods of calm and sad, with the preferred themes of loyalty and MORALITY, then a derived Chunk might end up with content genres of country, pop, and R&B, moods of calm and angry, and themes of power and loyalty. This ensures that each new Chunk is a variant of its 'parent' and helps maintain a diverse array of music preferences within the population.`

`Communities are classifications within the game used to group Audience Chunks. An Audience Chunk is associated with a community its preferences completely match the community's preferred content genres, moods, and themes. This matching process is essential for your game's logic as it allows for the dynamic organization of Chunks and contributes to the evolving ecosystem of virtual music consumption behaviors.`

9. **`Nationality`**`: Where the audience chunk comes from. This helps define which community they're a part of, showing us their music likes and dislikes.`

10. **`Emigration Rate`**`: How likely is the audience chunk to move to another country in the game. This can mix up music tastes in different places and change the music charts there.`  
11. **`Preferred content Genre`**`: A genre in the context of your game refers to the specific attributes related to the song's instrumentation and style of music that an audience chunk is inclined towards.`   
12. **`Preferred Mood`**`: The mood of a song as defined for your game revolves around the emotion it evokes in its listeners. This categorization helps identify the emotional response an audience chunk looks for in music. For instance, a song classified under 'Energetic' would be expected to invigorate and energize the audience, potentially featuring up-tempo beats and a lively arrangement.`  
13. **`Preferred Theme`**`: In the Record Label Simulator, the theme of a song refers to its lyrical content — the message or storytelling aspect that can resonate with an audience chunk's personal experiences or values. The themes you've presented — FREEDOM, LOYALTY, AMBITION, MORALITY, and POWER — each represent a different narrative focus that can appeal to an audience chunk's tastes.`  
14. **`Communities`**`: Within the game, Communities represent a classification system that groups audience chunks based on a harmony of preferred content genres, moods, and themes among its members. Communities facilitate a more organized approach to understanding and catering to the varied tastes of the game's virtual populace, providing players with the ability to strategically target specific clusters of the audience with music releases and marketing campaigns that align with Communitycharacteristics.`

`These comprehensive properties craft a dynamic and intricate audience environment within the game, compelling players to continuously modify their strategies to suit the changing audience demographics and music consumption trends.`

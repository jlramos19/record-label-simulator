KeyMate(Google+GPT-4): \# Record Label Simulator Consumption Algorithm

This document outlines the core gameplay loop of the Record Label Simulator music industry simulation game, focusing on the product consumption algorithm from the perspective of the audience.

\#\# Overview

Record Label Simulator simulates a music industry where the audience, categorized into demographic subcultures, interacts with products (e.g., songs, music videos, digital merchandise) produced by a Record Label (record label). Emotional resonance, stemming from the product's themes and the audience's current mood, forms the basis of the consumption behavior.

\#\# Consumptions Algorithm Steps

1\. \*\*Mood Determination\*\*: The current mood of various audience subcultures is the baseline that influences their interaction with products. Moods aren't tied to specific events or triggers and hence, multiple factors could contribute to the audience's mood at any given moment.

2\. \*\*Product Encounter\*\*: The audience encounters a product: a song, music video, or some form of digital merchandise. Each product comes with a specific theme that harbors an underlying emotion.

3\. \*\*Emotion Influence\*\*: The theme's underlying emotion interacts with the audience's current mood, significantly impacting their perception and engagement with the product.

4\. \*\*Feeling Evocation\*\*: Based on the interaction between mood and theme-related emotion, feelings are evoked in the audience. These feelings are personal, nuanced psychological responses that are potentially responsible for stirring up consumption behavior.

5\. \*\*Engagement Decision\*\*: Depending on whether the evoked feelings align positively, neutrally, or negatively with the audience mood, they decide their course of action. They engage with the product, leading to consumption, or disengage and move onto a different product, repeating the cycle.

Remember that the size of subcultures is always rounded to the nearest 1,000 (\`1K\`) unit. This ensures statistical soundness and consistent demographic data representation.

In a world with a population of \`10B\`, through a keen understanding of these interactions between moods, emotions, and feelings, you, as the Record Label CEO, can strategically create and market products for maximum reach, consumption, and influence. Master this emotional journey to succeed in the Record Label Simulator universe.

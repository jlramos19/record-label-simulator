The Act is formed by a Vocalist Creator ID.  
The Vocalist creates Live Performances (later on, the ID can create Demo Recordings too)  
The Act performs the Content (the Live Performance) at a Location which is in an Area, designated as a Building of type “Venue”  
The Community Members from the Community that prefers the Mood of the Live Performance are interested in that Content.  
Let’s say that the mood is “Calming” for the sake of this example.  
The Act \*\*reheases\*\* the Live Performance at the \*\*Rehearsal Studio\*\* which, for this example, can be within the Building that contains the Record Label. Remember that the type of the building is Record Label, just like previously, the type of the building was Venue for Live Performances.

The Creators and Guides are never seen, they are represented in-game in the UI as IDs that can be placed in the slots of the Areas, in this case, you would place a Performed ID on the Venue to perform the Live Performance for the Community Members that prefer the Mood of the Content being performed by the Creator and consumed by the Audience, in this case, calming.

Is this clear?

`Extend these bullet points:`  
`- city hall in center of capital city Bloomville, Annglora.` 

`- members ((deprecated term), capsules) spawn from city hall, walk on navmesh in terrain.` 

`- structure (building) pops up on empty lot next to path (paths are for path finding, there are no cars, capsules just walk).`

`- Structure is type building.` 

`- building becomes a residence building.` 

`- Member moves into the residence.` 

`- member goes out to find work.` 

`- there’s no jobs (yet) so member goes to institution to level up either songwriter or recorder skills.` 

`- member reaches level 3 of either skill. (cap is 10)`

`- member enters creator chamber to be signed to Record Label.` 

`- structure building office pops up.` 

`- becomes Record Label.` 

`- members start being signed to Record Label and a studio pops up.` 

`- the creators (as IDs in the UI) are equipped to recording studios.` 

`- creators start creating content.` 

`- songwriters create sheet music.` 

`- recorders can’t create content until sheet music is available.` 

`- recorders have sheet music available and equip it to the “sheet music” slot of the recording studio building structure.` 

`- demo recording is outputted by the recording studio into the Record Label’s inventory.` 

`- the music executive of the Record Label, who is the CEO as a role and also has the producer occupation, produces a track from the demo recording created by the recorder from the sheet music created by the songwriter creator.` 

`- the track is then scheduled for release and announced on eyeriSocial.` 

`- But before the track can be announced on eyeriSocial, a structure pops up and becomes a building of Office type, but instead of a Record Label office, it becomes an eyeriSocial office, here, members who are non creators can “present” content (by working for Record Labels and making the posts on eyeriSocial on the Record Label’s behalf).` 

`- the content (track) is then released. Remember the content genre of the content for this example is calming freedom.` 

`- Because the songwriter’s theme was freedom and the recorder’s mood was calming.` 

`- so then the consumer members all go and consume the content. They still don’t have a preferred content genre because they’ve never consumed content.` 

`- based on their properties, some specific members will have a preference for the content with the genre of calming freedom.` 

`- each member (and creator) can have two preferred themes and two preferred moods, for a total of four preferred content genres.` 

`- some members, after consuming the content, decide to rate it, and based on how many people agree, they become critics.` 

`- for example, at random, a member will post how they think an album is rated on a scale of one to ten based on quality.` 

`- and if many other members agree, this member's occupation changes from consumer to critic, if there is a slot available in a critics council for a critic of that content genre of content.` 

`- content then is rated on release date by critics rather than after it is released.` 

`- the members rate of quality is also aggregated and made an average for the other members (there will be different types of consumers that pay more attention the rating given by members than critics for deciding if to buy content of certain genres.)`

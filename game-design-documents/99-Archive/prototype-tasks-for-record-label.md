# **`Melody:`**

  * `Role: Melody is often the most recognizable and memorable part of a song. It's the aspect that listeners tend to focus on and can easily identify.`  
  * `Example: Think of the tune you sing when humming "Happy Birthday." That tune is the melody of the song.`

  # **`Harmony:`**

  * `Definition: Harmony refers to the simultaneous combination of different musical notes or pitches to create a pleasing sound. It supports and complements the melody.`  
  * `Role: Harmony adds depth, richness, and texture to the music. It's like the "bed" upon which the melody rests.`  
  * `Example: When you play a chord on a piano or guitar while singing a melody, the combination of the chord and melody creates harmony.`

  # **`Rhythm:`**

  * `Definition: Rhythm is the pattern of beats, accents, and time intervals in music. It's what gives music its sense of timing and groove.`  
  * `Role: Rhythm provides the structure and pulse of the music. It determines the tempo, the feel of the song (fast or slow), and influences how people move and dance to the music.`  
  * `Example: Clapping your hands to the beat of a song demonstrates the rhythm of the music.`

  # **`Lyrics:`**

  * `Definition: Lyrics are the words or text of a song. They convey the song's message, tell a story, or express emotions.`  
  * `Role: Lyrics provide the narrative or emotional content of the song. They often interact with the melody to create a powerful emotional impact.`

`Encouraging players to share their game experience on social media is an excellent way to promote your game and build a community around it. Here's a few ways how you can incentivize players to share their creations:`

1. `In-Game Rewards: Offer in-game bonuses or rewards for players who share their game content on social media. This could be additional resources, exclusive items, or special abilities in the game. Just make sure the rewards are appealing enough to incentivize sharing.`  
   2. `Social Competitions: Hold social media contests where players have to share their creations or game experiences. Winners could get special in-game rewards or even real-world prizes.`  
   3. `Feature Player Creations: Showcasing user-generated content on your game's official social media pages can incentivize players. Getting their creations featured can be a significant incentive for many players.`  
   4. `Promote Sharing: Make sharing easy and enticing. Provide a clear and accessible option for players to share their content directly from the game to their social media platforms.`  
   5. `Build Community: Encourage social interactions by fostering a close-knit community. Players would be more likely to share their creations if they feel part of a community.`  
   6. `Collaborate with Influencers: Partnering with influencers who already have a substantial following on these platforms to play your game and share their experiences can encourage their followers to do the same.`

   `Implementing these strategies can drive player engagement and provide free marketing for your game.`

\#\# One-Time Bailout

\- When the player's balance hits zero or goes into the negative for the first time, the bailout is offered as a choice.  
\- Accepting the bailout resets debt to 0, grants 10 million, and locks achievements.  
\- Declining the bailout ends the game immediately as a loss.  
\- If the player goes into negative balance again after accepting the bailout, the game is officially over, and the player loses.

\#\# Post-Victory Gameplay

\- Even after winning, players can choose to continue playing until the year 4000\.  
\- During this time, they can continue to earn EXP and improve their high score.

\#\# Game Over at Year 4000

\- Regardless of the player's status (whether they've won or lost), the game officially ends at the year 4000\.  
\- At this point, a "Game Over" message is displayed, along with the player's final EXP and the end date.

\#\# Online Leaderboard

\- The player's final EXP is then posted to an online leaderboard.  
\- This can be implemented through a web-based leaderboard service or a custom backend API.  
\- Players can compare their high scores with others, adding a competitive element to the game.

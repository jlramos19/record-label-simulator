Can you believe it?  
That I would eat it?  
I know it’s massive  
Brave I was acting

But anyway  
You were my first  
So what, my dude?  
You saw me nude

And it’s funny to accept  
I still remember your name  
Considering I never heard it before

Believe me, I can’t pretend  
Act like I forgot your face  
Considering I never saw it before

2. Shopping Center Personnel: distribute (Sell content).
3. Broadcast Corporation Personnel: present (Show content to audience).

## CREATOR (Role)

### Songwriter (Occupation)

### Vocalist (Occupation)

### Producer (Occupation)
- produce (Create Masters by combining Theme and Mood to assign content Genre, which also gives a preliminary Quality rating later combined with Critic ratings).

## ACT (Role)

### Promoter (Occupation)

## CEO (Role)

### Music Executive (Occupation)
- negotiate (Contracts with Creators to sign them).

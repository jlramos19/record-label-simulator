# **`Record Label Simulator – MVP Gameplay Overview`**

## **`Game Loop & Objectives`**

`Role & Cycle: In Record Label Simulator (RLS), you play as a music executive managing a record label (a "Record Label"). The core loop revolves around signing Creators (songwriters, recorders, producers), producing music content, and promoting it to climb the charts. The primary goals are to outperform rival AI labels on music charts and ultimately fulfill the CEO's "12 Requests" - special objectives like achieving #1 hits and best-sellers across Tracks, Projects (albums/EPs), promotions, and tours before the year 3000. Notably, the player must avoid becoming a monopoly; bankrupting all 7 rival labels triggers a loss condition despite commercial success. The game is open-ended beyond 3000, but these milestones frame the main victory conditions.`

`High-Level Loop: The gameplay progresses in repeating phases: (1) Recruit & assign Creators to projects, (2) Create content through multiple stages (composition to final track), (3) Release and promote content to audiences, (4) Monitor charts and trends for feedback, and (5) Adjust strategy (sign new talent, tweak content genres/themes, ramp up promotions) to begin the cycle anew. This loop occurs in a simulated time system where one in-game hour equals 25,000,000 ticks (about 2.5 real seconds), and one week (chart cycle) passes in 7 real minutes. A built-in calendar and time controls allow pausing or fast-forwarding as needed to manage this real-time simulation.`

## **`Creator Recruitment & Management`**

`Signing Creators: Your label can sign up to 125 Creator IDs (individual artists or personnel) at a time, encompassing Songwriters, Recorders, and Producers. These Creators are recruited from the community (the game world's population of "Community Members") once they develop the requisite skills. Signing happens through the CCC market: accepted offers deduct cash and move the Creator into the roster, while rejections lock the Sign button until the next 12AM refresh (precondition failures do not lock out). Each Creator may have unique preferences or proficiencies (e.g. favored Theme/Mood), and can be placed into available studio slots or training institutions to put them to work.`

`Roles & Functions:`

* `Songwriters – Create Sheet Music (melody/lyrics) that set the Theme of a track. They influence the narrative focus and should align with your target Alignment (Safe, Neutral, Risky) and regional tastes for best results.`

* `Recorders – Record Demo versions adding the Mood (emotional tone) to the track. A recorder’s skill can slightly boost quality at this stage, and their style should complement the chosen Theme.`

* `Producers – Handle the final Mastering, merging Theme + Mood into the track’s content Genre and polishing its Quality grade. High-skill producers with sufficient resources can elevate a song to an A-grade finish, crucial for critical acclaim and chart-topping potential.`

`Stamina & Catharsis: Creators track stamina for throughput (0-400) and catharsis for quality (a skill-weighted stamina score). Stage work spends stamina (Sheet 25, Demo 50, Master 100) and idle Creators regenerate 50 stamina per in-game hour. Catharsis is derived from skill and current stamina, so high-skill Creators stay steadier at low stamina. If a Creator spends more than 200 stamina in a day, they can accrue an overuse strike and may enter a departure state. Scheduling balances studio capacity, rest, and daily limits so the pipeline stays healthy without burnout.`

## **`Content Creation Pipeline`**

`Multi-Stage Creation: Producing a song (Track) is a three-phase process:`

1. `Sheet Music (Composition) – Created by a songwriter, establishing the track’s core Theme (e.g. Freedom, Ambition). This stage costs 25,000,000 ticks (≈1 in-game hour) per piece.`

2. `Demo Recording (Draft) – Recorded by a Recorder ID, layering on a Mood (e.g. Calming, Energizing, Daring) to shape the track’s emotional feel. Takes 50,000,000 ticks (≈2 hours).`

3. `Master Recording (Final Track) – Finalized by a producer who combines the Theme and Mood into the final content Genre classification and applies studio polish. This is the longest step at 75,000,000 ticks (≈3 hours) per track, reflecting the intensive effort to achieve high quality.`

`At each stage, the content’s Quality score improves incrementally, with the largest jump upon mastering. The simulation rates Quality on a 0–100 scale mapped to letter grades: A (90–100) denotes exceptional, likely hit-bound content; B (80–89) is strong; C (70–79) is average; D (60–69) subpar; F (<60) a failure. Poor-quality F tracks often result from mismatched or uninspired Theme/Mood combos (notably the Boring mood) and will struggle to engage audiences. Player decisions can influence these outcomes – for example, assigning higher-skilled creators or investing more resources yields better Quality, while misaligning a track’s style with its target audience can impose hidden Quality penalties (e.g. a great song that doesn’t fit the market may effectively perform as if lower quality).`

`Themes, Moods & content Genre: The choice of Theme (e.g. Freedom, Loyalty, Ambition, Morality, or Power) at the songwriting stage and Mood (e.g. Cheering, Calming, Thrilling, etc.) at the demo stage determines the content Genre of the finished track. There are 5 Themes × 9 Moods, but notably the “Boring” mood produces no popular trend (it yields a content Genre but never becomes a hit trend). That leaves 40 productive Theme–Mood combinations that can align with Trends. Choosing a Theme/Mood pairing that resonates with current cultural preferences yields a content Genre more likely to succeed (for example, Calming + Freedom might appeal strongly in one region, whereas Daring + Power is favored in another). Alignment also factors in: each Track or the Act behind it leans Safe, Neutral, or Risky in image. A Risky-themed song needs higher Quality to impress critics but can lead to bigger payoffs in certain markets, whereas Safe content earns steady approval where it aligns culturally. In short, crafting a hit is not just about maxing Quality – it’s about the right song for the right audience, balancing Theme, Mood, and Alignment to hit a cultural sweet spot.`

## **`Projects, Release & Distribution`**

`Tracks vs Projects: Once individual tracks are completed, they can be released standalone or bundled into Projects (music releases like Singles, EPs, or Albums). A Project is a container for multiple tracks - Singles allow 1-4 tracks, EPs allow 5-7 tracks, and Albums allow 8-32 tracks. Players select the project's tracklist order, which can have strategic implications (for example, putting a highly engaging track as the opener). Projects also carry aggregated stats like overall Quality or Alignment alignment via project-level components in the simulation, which influence how the release is received as a whole.`

`Release Scheduling: Releases can be physical (e.g. vinyl, CD) and/or digital. The game's distribution model (handled by in-world companies like eyeriStorage/eyeriShipping) imposes lead times - physical media requires a 2-week in-game lead for manufacturing, while digital releases typically use a 1-week prep window (rushable when chasing trends). This means the player must plan ahead on the calendar when sending a Project to distribution: a missed manufacturing window could delay a release and lose momentum. You coordinate release dates via the Calendar, often timing them to capitalize on market conditions (like dropping a new album right when its content genre is trending). If the label leases a Manufacturing or Distribution facility, those processes are abstracted, but you still must queue content in advance. All content ultimately hits the market through eyeriShopping centers (stores/online) where Community Members purchase or stream them.`

`Distribution Pricing & Tradeoffs: Digital releases are the fastest and lowest-overhead option (baseline single $0.69), ideal for trend-chasing or rapid market response. Physical releases command higher unit prices (baseline single $4.99 with project-type multipliers: Single 1.00x, EP 1.55x, Album 2.25x) plus a per-format release fee ($500). Physical runs use a 2-week lead and unit costs derived from the unit price (35% with a $0.50 floor). "Both" follows the physical lead time and costs but captures both channels. The 30-70 per-track pricing pattern is a legacy target and is not active in the web MVP.`

`Rival Distribution Logic: AI labels follow the same release guidance as the player: trend matches favor immediate digital releases, high-quality projects take the 2-week physical lead, and mid-tier releases use the 1-week digital prep window.`

`Promotion & Tours: In conjunction with a release, you can launch promotional campaigns and, eventually, concert tours. Promotion is essential to maximize audience awareness and engagement: you might invest in advertising, music videos, radio campaigns, or arrange live gigs to hype a track or project. The game encourages matching your promotional content to the target demographic - for example, showcasing the themes or moods that are currently popular, or focusing on regions where the content should perform best. High-Quality tracks derive greater benefit from promotions (good songs respond more to hype), and sustained promotion can extend a song's chart life. Tours are another promotional vector which, if successful, have their own charts and can feed back into music sales and popularity.`

## **`Audience, Trends & Regions`**

`Audience Segments: The world of RLS is divided into 3 nations – Annglora (Safe-leaning), Bytenza (Neutral-leaning), and Crowlya (Risky-leaning) – each nation further split into 2 regions (a capital region and an “elsewhere” region). These six regions have distinct audience preferences and cultural biases. For example, Annglora’s audience strongly favors content with Safe Alignments and “Freedom”-themed messages, while Crowlya’s audience is excited by Risky, bold content, especially with Power themes and daring moods. Bytenza sits in between with Neutral tastes (e.g. ambitious, balanced content). Each Community Member (the simulated consumers in these regions) belongs to an Audience Chunk with specific affinities (a chunk might be, say, young urban Crowlyans who love Daring moods). These chunks aggregate consumer behavior for performance calculations.`

`Trends System: Trends emerge from what’s popular on the charts. Every in-game week (each tick week equals 7 real minutes), a Trend Analysis runs to update the Top 3 content Genres globally and per nation/region. Essentially, the simulation looks at which Theme+Mood combinations (content Genres) are performing best and declares them trending. Trends are influenced by both audience consumption and Critics’ Council input – high critical acclaim for a content genre can amplify its trend momentum. If, for example, several top tracks are Calming Freedom songs, “Calming Freedom” might become a hot trend, boosting audience interest in that style. Trend status confers bonuses: content that matches a top trend can see accelerated audience uptake (TrendModifier components in the game data boost engagement for trending content genres). This creates a feedback loop – popular content makes a genre trend, which in turn encourages more consumption of that content genre.`

`Regional Variation: Trends are tracked globally and regionally. A content genre might be #1 worldwide but only #3 in a particular region if it clashes with local taste. Each region has a Regional Trend Bias – they adopt certain content genres faster and hold onto them longer if culturally aligned. For example, a Daring Mood trend might catch fire in Crowlya’s regions but fizzle in conservative Annglora. Players must read the charts to identify these nuances and may tailor releases for specific regions (e.g. releasing a different single in Bytenza vs. Crowlya to maximize resonance in each market). Over time, audience preferences can evolve: the simulation gradually shifts Audience Chunk tastes (via probabilistic changes each era or in response to repeated exposure to high-quality content), so today’s fad may wane and a once-niche content genre could rise. The MVP ensures that no strategy stays optimal forever – you’ll need to monitor trend reports and adjust your label’s creative direction continuously.`

## **`Critics & Quality Feedback`**

`Critics’ Councils: The game features independent Critics Councils (nonprofit institutions) that review and score your Tracks and Projects. Each council has its own cultural leanings and Alignment biases – for instance, an Anngloran Critics Council might heavily favor Safe, socially conscious music, while a Crowlyan council rewards Risky experimental work . When you release content, these councils evaluate it on multiple factors: Quality grade, Theme/Mood alignment, and Alignment of the content/artist . The result is a composite Critic Score. The simulation might weight these factors (e.g. 50% raw Quality, 30% how well your Alignment fits their values, 20% Theme/Mood novelty or alignment) to generate the score . A track that is A-quality and perfectly on-message for a council’s taste can earn rave reviews (e.g. 9/10, “Critics’ Pick”), whereas a lower-quality song or one that clashes with their values gets mediocre ratings. These scores aren’t just fluff – they feed back into the game’s systems. Strong Critic endorsement gives your content a boost in visibility and Trend influence (critics can essentially accelerate a trend by signaling a content genre’s artistic merit) . Conversely, poor reviews can slow audience uptake, especially among more discerning audience segments.`

`Alignment Alignment: Alignment (Safe/Neutral/Risky) plays a big role in how critics and certain audiences perceive content . Each Critics Council has a Alignment Alignment component defining what they favor or disfavor . For example, a Safe-leaning council will automatically be skeptical of Risky content regardless of quality, and a Risky-leaning council might find Safe content too bland. Thus, part of the strategic depth is deciding what Alignment to cultivate for your acts/label. A high-risk Alignment means you’ll appeal strongly to certain critics and regions (and potentially achieve Iconic Eras, which require taking big swings), but you’ll need to consistently hit high Quality to avoid criticism . A Safe rep, meanwhile, yields easier, steady approvals but might never reach the dramatic peaks of Risky content. The MVP’s design allows players to pursue any Alignment strategy, as long as they manage the trade-offs. Notably, Iconic Era status (a late-game achievement) often requires impressing Risky-taste critics with top-quality work , showing the interplay between taking risks and reaping rewards.`

`Feedback & Adaptation: The game provides immediate feedback on why a piece of content is succeeding or flopping. In the UI, you can inspect a track’s reception to see critic remarks or audience comments (e.g. a tooltip might say “Crowlya Critics Council applauds the daring theme” or “Audiences in Annglora find the mood too risky”) . This helps you pinpoint if, say, the Quality was fine but the Mood was off for the target audience. Using this info, you might decide to pivot your next project’s Theme/Mood or double down on a winning formula. In essence, Critics and Audience form a loop: Critics’ scores sway audience interest and chart placement, and chart success in turn informs what is trending, which then guides your next content decisions . The simulation ensures that continuously pleasing critics can lead to more stable long-term success (since you’re often riding or setting trends, not chasing them), whereas ignoring cultural feedback might cause short-lived hits or outright misses.`

## **`Charting & Performance Metrics`**

`Charts Hierarchy: RLS tracks your success through multiple music charts updated weekly. At the top is the Global Top 100 chart – the definitive ranking of songs (or projects) across all regions. Below that are National Top 40 charts (one per nation), reflecting popularity across the entire nation. At the most local level, each region has its own Regional Top 10, reflecting local popularity in that specific market. When you release a track or project, it will enter these charts if its performance merits it.`

`There may also be content-genre/trend charts that rank top content within a particular content genre or trend, if those are enabled as a separate UI surface (these charts should follow the same “simplify for the player” philosophy).`

`Chart position is determined by a combination of sales, streaming, audience engagement, and critic score, with weighting that can vary slightly by region. For instance, one simplified model gives Engagement about 40% weight, physical sales 30%, digital 20%, and critics 10% in computing a score that determines rank. A high Quality track with strong promotions might shoot to #1 in a receptive region’s chart, while the same track could chart lower elsewhere. The chart update cycle is every in-game week (i.e. every 7 minutes real-time, all charts refresh), showing moves up/down, new entries, or returning hits.`

`Feedback Loops: Chart performance isn’t just an end-state, but a signal for strategy. If you see your song jump to #5 in Crowlya but linger lower in Annglora, it tells you something (Crowlya’s audience loves it; Annglora is lukewarm). This might prompt extra marketing in the weaker region, or acceptance that the song’s style just isn’t for everyone. Consistent high-charting content in a region will also grow your fanbase there and could gradually shift audience preferences (people get used to your style). Moreover, songs dominating the charts directly reinforce Trends: a content genre that occupies multiple top slots will likely see its Trend strength increase, leading more audience members to seek that content genre. The player, in turn, might lean into that trend with similar content to secure an Era of dominance.`

`There is also interplay with rivals – AI labels release their own content that competes on the charts. You may find that a rival’s big release knocks your song down a few spots, forcing you to respond (perhaps by upping promotions, cutting prices, or fast-tracking a new release in a different niche). The presence of up to 7 AI competitors ensures the charts are dynamic; if one label starts sweeping the charts, others might adjust tactics or lose market share. Ultimately, maintaining strong chart performance across multiple regions over time is necessary to meet the CEO’s victory conditions (many of the “12 Requests” involve year-end chart or sales titles), so the chart system is both a scoreboard and a guide for the player’s next moves.`

## **`Economic Management (Studios, Money & Resources)`**

`Studios & Infrastructure: To create content, you need recording studios and other facilities, which are not owned outright in the beginning but leased. In the game world, an entity called eyeriS Corp controls most infrastructure and leases it to labels at set rates . For example, you might lease a small studio for a 4-year term at $44 million (in-game currency) . Lease management becomes an ongoing cost: if a lease expires and you don’t renew (or can’t afford to), the building “despawns” – you lose access to that studio, and any ongoing projects or creator assignments there are paused and returned to your inventory (with partial progress saved) . Eventually, a successful label can consider buying/constructing studios to eliminate lease fees (the game notes that 48 years of leasing equals roughly the purchase cost) , but such long-term investments may be beyond the MVP scope and more relevant in extended play. Besides studios, there are other structures: e.g. Community Chambers (institutions for training creators, funded by government subsidies) and venues/offices, each with their own mechanics and costs . Managing these resources introduces a light city-building element – though you don’t place buildings manually in MVP, you choose which to lease and when to upgrade capacity, balancing expansion with budget.`

`Revenue & Expenses: Your label's finances cover a wide array of income and cost streams. On the income side, you earn money from digital sales (downloads/streams of tracks and projects), physical sales (CDs, vinyl with higher price points), merchandise, live tours, and a streaming subscription service (eyeriSound at $14.99/month per subscriber) for steady recurring income. Each format has baseline prices - digital singles start at $0.69 and physical singles at $4.99 with project-type multipliers - plus physical release fees and unit costs. On the expense side, you must pay Creator salaries, studio leases, promotional campaign costs, and maintenance/upkeep on any infrastructure. The simulation's Economics system tallies revenues and expenses weekly, updating your net profit. If you overspend (e.g. massive marketing, high salaries) without enough hits, your cash can dwindle, potentially leading to bankruptcy. Conversely, consistent chart successes can snowball revenue (especially if you exploit high-margin physical runs or efficient digital distribution). There is also a light government subsidy element: maintaining a culturally positive Alignment (like Safe content in a Safe-preferring nation) can yield grants to your associated institutions, indirectly boosting your finances. For MVP, these economic levers ensure the player not only focuses on making hits but also making profits, adding a layer of tycoon strategy to the simulation.`

`Modifiers & Items: Throughout gameplay, you can acquire or unlock special Modifier items that temporarily enhance or tweak production. These are one-use or limited-use resources reflecting, for example, technological boosts or creative stimulants. For instance: Sensory Sage is an item that increases Quality output of a content creator at the cost of slower production speed (they work more meticulously) . On the flip side, Dispatch Dust speeds up content creation (faster output) but causes a drop in Quality – useful if you need to rush out content, but risky for your Alignment . There are also modifiers that affect Creator preferences or skills; the Revamper, for example, lets you change a Creator’s preferred Theme or Mood . This could be used to retrain an artist to follow a trend (e.g. make a recorder who usually prefers “Calming” moods start favoring “Daring” moods if the market demands it). These items are typically found or earned via quests or as perks from Institutions. While not absolutely essential to use, they can provide a strategic edge in the content creation loop – essentially acting as power-ups to fine-tune your pipeline or adapt to sudden changes. The presence of such modifiers indicates the game’s depth in simulation: beyond baseline stats, players can intervene in the system in creative ways. (If a term like a particular modifier or system appears undocumented in design files, it would be noted as a placeholder for future development – for example, any “modifiers that modify content creation focus” beyond those listed are a work in progress in the design .)`

## **`User Interface & Controls`**

`Time & Pace: The UI features a top bar with the current in-game date/time and controls to adjust time flow . You can pause, run at normal speed, fast-forward, or even skip ahead in time to breeze through waiting periods . The date is displayed in a format like SAT – JAN 01, 2400 – 12AM, since the simulation actually begins far in the future (after a historical sim from 2025-2200 as a fixed baseline, plus a uniquely seeded 2200-2400 run that pre-seeds the world state) . This gives context (e.g. charts have history, and the world has evolved culturally by the time you start). The use of a tick-based clock and the ability to pause or speed up means the player can micromanage when needed (pause to assign tasks, schedule releases) and then accelerate through routine stretches.`

`Main Panels: The interface uses routed views rather than persistent side panels. The top nav switches between Dashboard, Charts, Create, Release, Calendar, Eras, Roster, Community (CCC), Promotions, and Tour. Each view owns its main panel and optional side panels, which can be toggled per view. CEO Requests and status surfaces live on the Dashboard, while scheduling lives in Release and Calendar views.`

* `(Additionally, context menus and overlay windows pop up for detailed information: e.g. clicking a Creator opens their Creator Card with stats, skills, and preferences; clicking a Track shows its quality, theme, mood, and critic feedback.)`

`Visual Style: The game emphasizes a dense, readable UI surface for the web app. In early gameplay, Members (general population NPCs) can be represented as simple UI avatars or list entries on a map-like panel (movement is simulated by timers and state changes). When those members become Creators (e.g. you sign a songwriter), they are removed from the public map/list and represented in the UI as an ID or card. This indicates a shift from the simulation world to the management interface - a deliberate design to prevent clutter and focus the player on managing through the UI once individuals "join" your organization. The UI conveys a lot of data in text and pill labels (for instance, Theme/Mood labels on a track, colored letters for Quality grade, arrows for chart movement). Tooltips and highlight colors are used to guide the player; for example, a track trending upward on a chart might be highlighted green with an upward arrow, and hovering it would show "+5 positions (Critics' Choice award bonus)". Similarly, if a Creator is low on stamina/catharsis, their portrait might flash or a tooltip might warn "Needs rest". These interface choices ensure that while the simulation data is complex, the player can quickly scan and understand the status and make informed decisions without needing to read raw numbers continuously.`

## **`Conclusion & Future Expansion`**

`In its MVP form, Record Label Simulator offers a comprehensive simulation of running a music label, focusing on the intertwined systems of content production, cultural trends, and business management. The gameplay we’ve described is the stable foundation – all the key loops (signing talent, making tracks, marketing them, reading feedback, and reinvesting profits) function together coherently. Notably, this foundation was built in a data-driven way (using an ECS architecture under the hood), which means adding complexity is straightforward without breaking existing systems . Future expansions can layer on more depth – e.g. additional content types, more nuanced artist personalities, dynamic events like music awards, or even story-driven scenarios – without changing the core loop. The design decisions captured here are the “latest and most stable” agreed-upon mechanics, balancing realism and fun: every stat has a purpose, every system feeds into another (a true gameplay loop), and the player is rewarded for understanding the flow of stats to strategy (how a songwriter’s skill leads to a Quality track, which leads to chart success, which fuels trend momentum, which suggests the next creative direction, and so on). By mastering these loops – and keeping an eye on those CEO Requests – players can guide their record label from obscurity to an Iconic Era of musical dominance, all while adapting to the ever-evolving world of trends and tastes.`

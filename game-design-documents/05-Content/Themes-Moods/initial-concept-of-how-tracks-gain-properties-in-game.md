# Initial Concept of how Tracks gain Properties in-game

A track in Record Label *Simulator* starts with a **Songwriter** creating **Sheet Music**. The *Theme* such as "*Freedom*", "*Loyalty*", or "*Power*" is selected and embedded into the sheet music, setting the narrative foundation for the track.

Next, a **Vocalist** creates a **Demo Recording**, introducing a *Mood* to the track. This could be "*Cheering*", "*Saddening*", or "*Energizing*", and it shapes the track's emotional tone.

A **Producer** then assigns a *Music Genre* to the demo recording by combining its theme and mood into options like "*Calming Freedom*", "*Angering Loyalty*", or "*Energizing Ambition*". This content genre labeling influences how the track is categorized and marketed within the game.

Lastly, the track’s *Quality* is determined by **Critics**. Critics belong to councils like the "*Global Neutral 'Calming Freedom' Critics’ Council*" or the "*Global Risky 'Angering Loyalty' Critics’ Council*". They evaluate the track based on its *Alignment*, which can be "*Safe*", "*Neutral*", or "*Risky*", impacting the final assessment of the track.

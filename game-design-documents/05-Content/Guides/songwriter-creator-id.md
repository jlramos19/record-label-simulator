The start setup is the CEO with nothing. Then he can sign creator IDs from the community deck of creator IDs. He can use his initial THEME for FREEDOM to sign creator IDs with MOODs. MOODs can be manifested into specific feelings that the songwriter creator ID can express through being given a theme which is based on the CEO’s THEME, so the songwriter creator ID now has a theme of FREEDOM. For an example, let’s say that the songwriter creator ID has the MOOD  “happy”, then he can put feelings of joy and excitement to the Sheet Music. 

MOODs will have feelings associated to them, these fluctuate overtime, the goal of the CEO is to pair his THEMEs as themes with the CEO’s MOODs that will be shown as the feelings of the Sheet Music. The goal is to maintain the feelings as constant as possible until it reaches the audience once published. GUIDE IDs help creator IDs focus on channeling specific feelings to put on the Sheet Music and other creative works like Tracks, studio albums, music video tapes, interview tapes, concert tours, etc.

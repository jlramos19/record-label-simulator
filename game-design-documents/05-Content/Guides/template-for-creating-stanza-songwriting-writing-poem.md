`### Template for Creating a Stanza`

`#### Step-by-Step Process`

`1. **Create the First Line:**`  
   `- Write the line.`  
   `- Split the line by words.`  
   `- Split the words by syllables.`  
   `- Count the syllables in every word.`  
   `- Sum the total syllables in the line and store it.`  
   `- Identify if there is a comma.`  
   `- If there is a comma, note its position by syllable count and store this information.`  
   `- Split the line into two phrases at the comma.`

`2. **Find the Rhyming Word for the First Phrase:**`  
   `- Identify the word type of the last syllable before the comma.`  
   `- List five potential rhyming words of the same type.`  
   `- Choose the most suitable word based on meaning and context.`

`3. **Create the Second Line:**`  
   `- Write the first phrase up to the comma.`  
   `- Split the phrase by words.`  
   `- Split the words by syllables.`  
   `- Count the syllables in every word.`  
   `- Sum the total syllables in the phrase.`  
   `- Compare the syllable count up to the comma with the first line; they must match.`  
   `- If the syllable counts do not match, rewrite the phrase.`  
   `- If the syllable counts match, proceed to write the second phrase.`  
   `- Ensure the total syllable count of the second phrase equals the total syllables of the line minus the syllables of the first phrase.`

`4. **Verify Rhymes:**`  
   `- Check if the last syllable before the comma in the first phrase of each line rhymes using phonetic comparison.`  
   `- Check if the last syllable of the entire line rhymes with the last syllable of the other line.`

`### Example Template`

`#### Step 1: Create the First Line`

`**First Line:** "In the quiet night, I hear the ocean's call,"`  
`- **Split by Words:** "In" "the" "quiet" "night," "I" "hear" "the" "ocean's" "call,"`  
`- **Split by Syllables:**`  
  `- In: 1 syllable`  
  `- the: 1 syllable`  
  `- qui-et: 2 syllables (qui-et)`  
  `- night: 1 syllable`  
  `- I: 1 syllable`  
  `- hear: 1 syllable`  
  `- the: 1 syllable`  
  `- o-cean's: 2 syllables (o-cean's)`  
  `- call: 1 syllable`

`- **Count Syllables:**`   
  `- In: 1`  
  `- the: 1`  
  `- quiet: 2`  
  `- night: 1`  
  `- I: 1`  
  `- hear: 1`  
  `- the: 1`  
  `- ocean's: 2`  
  `- call: 1`  
  `- **Total:** 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 11 syllables`

`- **Identify Comma Position:** After "night" (4 syllables)`  
`- **Split into Phrases:**`  
  `- First phrase: "In the quiet night," (4 syllables)`  
  `- Second phrase: "I hear the ocean's call," (7 syllables)`

`### Step 2: Find the Rhyming Word for the First Phrase`

`- **Last Syllable of the First Phrase:** "night"`  
`- **Word Type:** Noun`

`**Potential Rhyming Words for "Night" (Noun):**`  
`1. Light`  
`2. Flight`  
`3. Sight`  
`4. Height`  
`5. Might`

`- **Chosen Word:** "Light"`  
`- **Justification:** "Light" is a noun that fits well within the context of the night, enhancing the imagery of the poem.`

`### Step 3: Create the Second Line`

`**First Phrase:** "Under the moon's light,"`  
`- **Split by Words:** "Under" "the" "moon's" "light,"`  
`- **Split by Syllables:**`  
  `- Un-der: 2 syllables (un-der)`  
  `- the: 1 syllable`  
  `- moon's: 1 syllable`  
  `- light: 1 syllable`

`- **Count Syllables:**`  
  `- Un-der: 2`  
  `- the: 1`  
  `- moon's: 1`  
  `- light: 1`  
  `- **Total:** 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 syllables (does not match 4 syllables)`  
`- **Rewrite Phrase:** "Beneath the moon's light,"`  
  `- Be-neath: 2`  
  `- the: 1`  
  `- moon's: 1`  
  `- light: 1`  
  `- **Total:** 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 syllables`

`- **Verify Syllable Count:** Matches the first phrase of the first line (4 syllables)`

`**Second Phrase:** Determine the word type and rhyme for "call" (Noun)`

`### Potential Rhyming Words for "Call" (Noun)`  
`1. Fall`  
`2. Hall`  
`3. Ball`  
`4. Wall`  
`5. Tall`

  `- hear: 1`  
  `- the: 1`  
  `- ech-oes: 2`  
  `- fall: 1`  
  `- **Total:** 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 syllables`

`- **Verify Syllable Count:** Matches the second phrase of the first line (7 syllables)`

`### Verification of the Second Line`

`**First Line:** "In the quiet night, I hear the ocean's call,"`  
`**Second Line:** "Beneath the moon's light, I hear the echoes fall."`

`- **Syllable Count:**`  
  `- "In the quiet night," (4 syllables) matches "Beneath the moon's light," (4 syllables)`  
  `- "I hear the ocean's call," (7 syllables) matches "I hear the echoes fall." (7 syllables)`

`- **Rhyming Pairs:**`  
  `- Last syllable of the first phrases: "night" rhymes with "light"`  
  `- Last syllable of the second phrases: "call" rhymes with "fall"`

`### Final First Pair of Lines`

`In the quiet night, I hear the ocean's call,`    
`Beneath the moon's light, I hear the echoes fall.`

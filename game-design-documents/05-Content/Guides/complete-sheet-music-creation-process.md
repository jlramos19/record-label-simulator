`### Complete Sheet Music Creation Process in "Record Label Simulator"`

`#### Overview:`  
`The Songwriter Creator ID creates sheet music in a recording studio structure. The Executive Producer (player) places the Songwriter ID into a slot in the recording studio to start the creation process.`

`### Step-by-Step Process:`

`1. **Placing the Songwriter ID**:`  
   `- The Executive Producer (player) selects a Songwriter Creator ID.`  
   `- The Songwriter ID is placed into an available slot in the recording studio structure.`

`2. **Starting the Creation Process**:`  
   `- Once placed in the slot, the Songwriter begins working on sheet music.`  
   `- The creation process is divided into intervals to ensure consistent progress.`

`3. **Intervals and Stamina Usage**:`  
   `- The total time to create one sheet of music is divided into **5 intervals**.`  
   `- Each interval represents **12 in-game minutes** and **0.5 real-life seconds**.`  
   `- Each interval consumes 5 stamina units from the Songwriter’s total stamina.`

`4. **Ticks and Time Equivalents**:`  
   `- **Total Ticks per Sheet Music**: 25,000,000 ticks`  
   `- **Ticks per Interval**: 5,000,000 ticks`  
   `- **In-Game Minutes per Interval**: 12 minutes`  
   `- **Real-Life Seconds per Interval**: 0.5 seconds`  
   `- **Completion Percentage per Interval**: 20%`

`5. **Stamina Management**:`  
   `- Each interval consumes 5 stamina units (since 1,000,000 ticks = 1 stamina unit).`  
   `- Over the 5 intervals, the total stamina consumed is cumulative.`

`6. **Completion**:`  
   `- After completing all 5 intervals, one sheet of music is fully created.`  
   `- The sheet music is then stored in the Executive Producer’s (player’s) inventory.`

`### Time Intervals Breakdown:`

`| Interval | Total Ticks | Total In-Game Minutes | Total Real-Life Seconds | Completion Percentage | Total Stamina Consumption |`  
`|----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|`  
`| 1        | 5,000,000   | 12                    | 0.5                     | 20%                   | 5                         |`  
`| 2        | 10,000,000  | 24                    | 1.0                     | 40%                   | 10                        |`

`| 5        | 25,000,000  | 60                    | 2.5                     | 100%                  | 25                        |`

`### Summary:`  
`- **Songwriter Creator ID** is placed in the **recording studio** by the Executive Producer (player).`  
`- **Creation Process**: Divided into 5 intervals of 12 in-game minutes each.`  
`- **Real-Life vs. In-Game Time**: Each interval is 0.5 real-life seconds.`  
`- **Cumulative Stamina Consumption**: Cumulative stamina consumed increases by 5 units each interval, totaling 25 units for full creation.`  
`- **Completion**: Each interval progresses the sheet music creation by 20%, completing it in 5 intervals.`

`This detailed explanation provides a clear understanding of how the Songwriter Creator ID creates sheet music within the game's mechanics, highlighting the cumulative time intervals, cumulative stamina management, and overall progress.`

`### Complete Demo Recording Creation Process in "Record Label Simulator"`

`#### Overview:`  
`The Vocalist Creator ID creates demo recordings in a recording studio structure. The Executive Producer (player) places the Vocalist ID into a slot in the recording studio to start the creation process.`

`### Step-by-Step Process:`

`1. **Placing the Vocalist ID**:`  
   `- The Executive Producer (player) selects a Vocalist Creator ID.`  
   `- The Vocalist ID is placed into an available slot in the recording studio structure.`

`2. **Starting the Creation Process**:`  
   `- Once placed in the slot, the Vocalist begins working on demo recordings.`  
   `- The creation process is divided into intervals to ensure consistent progress.`

`3. **Intervals and Stamina Usage**:`  
   `- The total time to create one demo recording is divided into **10 intervals**.`  
   `- Each interval represents **12 in-game minutes** and **0.5 real-life seconds**.`  
   `- Each interval consumes 5 stamina units from the Vocalist’s total stamina.`

`4. **Ticks and Time Equivalents**:`  
   `- **Total Ticks per Demo Recording**: 50,000,000 ticks`  
   `- **Ticks per Interval**: 5,000,000 ticks`  
   `- **In-Game Minutes per Interval**: 12 minutes`  
   `- **Real-Life Seconds per Interval**: 0.5 seconds`  
   `- **Completion Percentage per Interval**: 10%`

`5. **Stamina Management**:`  
   `- Each interval consumes 5 stamina units (since 1,000,000 ticks = 1 stamina unit).`  
   `- Over the 10 intervals, the total stamina consumed is cumulative.`

`6. **Completion**:`  
   `- After completing all 10 intervals, one demo recording is fully created.`  
   `- The demo recording is then stored in the Executive Producer’s (player’s) inventory.`

`### Summary:`  
`- **Vocalist Creator ID** is placed in the **recording studio** by the Executive Producer (player).`  
`- **Creation Process**: Divided into 10 intervals of 12 in-game minutes each.`  
`- **Real-Life vs. In-Game Time**: Each interval is 0.5 real-life seconds.`  
`- **Cumulative Stamina Consumption**: Cumulative stamina consumed increases by 5 units each interval, totaling 50 units for full creation.`  
`- **Completion**: Each interval progresses the demo recording creation by 10%, completing it in 10 intervals.`

`This detailed explanation provides a clear understanding of how the Vocalist Creator ID creates demo recordings within the game's mechanics, highlighting the cumulative time intervals, cumulative stamina management, and overall progress.`

`These tables provide a detailed overview of the cumulative progress for creating sheet music, demo recordings, and finalizing tracks in "Record Label Simulator." They include total ticks, in-game minutes, real-life seconds, completion percentages, and total stamina consumption for each interval.`  
`In your Record Label Simulator, the creation process for Sheet Music, Demo Recordings, and Masters involves detailed, time-based increments where a Creator’s stamina is used to progress each piece of content towards completion. Here’s how each process works:`

`### Complete Sheet Music Creation Process`

`#### Sheet Music Creation`  
`- **Creator ID**: Songwriter`  
`- **Content**: Sheet Music`  
`- **Time Frame**:`  
  `- **Total Ticks**: 4 quarter-hour ticks`  
  `- **Completion Time**: 1 in-game hour (2.5 real-life seconds at Play speed, 1 second at Fast)`  
`- **Stamina Consumption**: 25 units`  
`- **Intervals**:`  
  `- 4 intervals (quarter-hour ticks). Stamina slices: 7, 6, 6, 6. Completion: 25% per interval.`

`### Complete Demo Recording Creation Process`

`#### Demo Recording Creation`  
`- **Creator ID**: Performer`  
`- **Content**: Demo Recordings`  
`- **Time Frame**:`  
  `- **Total Ticks**: 8 quarter-hour ticks`  
  `- **Completion Time**: 2 in-game hours (5 real-life seconds at Play speed, 2 seconds at Fast)`  
`- **Stamina Consumption**: 50 units`  
`- **Intervals**:`  
  `- 8 intervals (quarter-hour ticks). Stamina slices: 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6. Completion: 12.5% per interval.`

`### Complete Masters Recording Process`

`#### Masters Recording Creation`  
`- **Creator ID**: Producer`  
`- **Content**: Masters (Finalized Tracks)`  
`- **Time Frame**:`  
  `- **Total Ticks**: 12 quarter-hour ticks`  
  `- **Completion Time**: 3 in-game hours (7.5 real-life seconds at Play speed, 3 seconds at Fast)`  
`- **Stamina Consumption**: 100 units`  
`- **Intervals**:`  
  `- 12 intervals (quarter-hour ticks). Stamina slices: 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. Completion: ~8.33% per interval.`

`These structured processes ensure that each piece of content progresses through defined stages, with stamina consumption and time intervals clearly outlined. This methodical approach mirrors real-life production environments where projects move through various stages of development, requiring careful management of resources and time.`

`If further details are needed to refine these processes or to adjust the stamina consumption and interval distributions, please let me know!`

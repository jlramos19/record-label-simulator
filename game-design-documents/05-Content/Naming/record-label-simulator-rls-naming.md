# **Evolution of the Project’s Name**

## **Phase 1 — Studio Name (Topoda Charts)**

Original Use: Early studio placeholder used in drafts; not a game title.

Status Now: No longer the name of the game.

Current Role: Topoda Charts is the development company’s name, preserving its legacy while distinguishing it from the product.

## **Phase 2 — Record Label Simulator RLS**

Context: Adopted after refining the scope of the project. It clearly identifies the player’s role and core gameplay loop—running a record label.

Status Now: Final and canon name of the game.

Acronym: Always referred to as RLS in all documentation and in-game references.

## **Summary**

• The game went through three identity drafts before settling on RLS (Record Label Simulator).

• Topoda Charts is the official name of the developing company; the game title remains Record Label Simulator (RLS).

## **In-Universe Naming**

- Record Label Simulator is a player-facing product name, not an in-world term.
- In lore and dialogue, refer to Gaia, nations/regions, charts, institutions, or labels instead of the game title.
- Avoid referencing "Record Label Simulator" inside narrative text, NPC dialogue, or in-world artifacts.
- Chart scope naming can use place or scope: Global = Gaia, National = nation (ex: Annglora), Regional = region name (ex: Bloomville) with a Regional suffix.
- When clarity matters, pair both (ex: "Gaia (Global)", "Annglora (National)", "Bloomville Capital (Regional)").

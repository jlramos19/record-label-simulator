# Record Label Simulator - Assistant and Web Project Instructions

## Web Project Scope
- This project is a browser-based simulation (HTML/CSS/TypeScript).
- UI is data-driven and view-routed; no engine runtime or scene graph.

## Data and Systems
- Game state is stored in structured JS/TS objects.
- Systems update state via deterministic rules and emit logs.
- Data assets live in JSON/CSV within the repo.

## Persistence
- Use localStorage/IndexedDB for saves and debug exports.
- Provide import/export hooks for testing and balancing.

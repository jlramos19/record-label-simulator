# Agent Guide - Record Label Simulator

- Docs live in GitHub `docs/` (canon root); the decision register is `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- GDD folder (Game Development Documents) lives at `game-development-documents/` (dashed, repo root).
- Google Drive mirrors GitHub; Drive is not canon.
- Conflicts are resolved case-by-case with GitHub as the tie-breaker.
- Unity-era content is retconned into web equivalents; keep concepts, rewrite Unity tooling language.
- Workflow: TODO -> Docs -> Code -> Patch Notes.
- When you stage changes in git, draft a commit message for me to push to main on GitHub.
- References: `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/CONTRADICTIONS.md`.
- Coordination: Other AI agents may work in this repo; coordinate changes, avoid overlapping edits, and stop to ask when conflicts appear.
- Coordination addendum: If other agents made local changes that do not conflict with the task, incorporate them into the current pass.

# Agent Guide - Record Label Simulator

- Docs live in GitHub `docs/` (canon root); the decision register is `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- GDD folder (Game Development Documents) lives at `docs/game-development-documents/` (full name, dashed, inside `docs/`).
- Google Drive mirrors GitHub; Drive is not canon.
- Conflicts are resolved case-by-case with GitHub as the tie-breaker.
- Unity-era content is retconned into web equivalents; keep concepts, rewrite Unity tooling language.
- Workflow: TODO -> Docs -> Code -> Patch Notes.
- When you stage changes in git, draft a commit message for me to push to main on GitHub.
- References: `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/CONTRADICTIONS.md`.
- If other agents are working in the repo, continue your task unless you hit conflicts; when conflicts appear, stop and ask blocking questions.

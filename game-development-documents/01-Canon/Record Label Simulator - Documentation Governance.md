# Record Label Simulator - Documentation Governance

## Canon and Mirrors
- Drive is canon for design/spec. Code lives in the repo.
- The Codex repo is a structured mirror of Drive canon.
- CONTRADICTIONS.md is the merge queue for any conflict or missing canon detail.
 - Legacy prototypes are historical only; do not use them as UI baselines.

## Contradictions Phases
- Unanswered: Logged conflict awaiting JL decision.
- Answered but undocumented: JL decided in chat, Drive not updated yet.
- Answered and documented: Drive updated; mirror updated.
- [Removed]: Conflict resolved and entry archived.

## Pending Concepts
- Use docs/pending-concepts.md for referenced-but-unspecified concepts.
- Pending Concepts are not conflicts; they are gaps to fill.

## Doc Sync Workflow
1) Read Drive canon and relevant mirror docs.
2) Apply changes to mirror docs in the same change set as code.
3) Log contradictions or missing canon details.

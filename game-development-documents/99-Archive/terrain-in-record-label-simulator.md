Each terrain will be a tile, the tiles will then auto populate based on demand to be a road or structure. 

If the game needs a structure but there are no ways for community members to enter the structure, a road will spawn instead. 

Procedural generation:  
The city hall is in the center of the terrain acting as a structure where the community members spawn from. The city hall then creates a neighboring terrain to the north, 24 x 24 too. Then the right, then the bottom, then the left. All these new neighboring terrains have an index: the city hall is 0, then 1, 2, 3, and 4 for top, right, bottom, and left paths. Remember that what spawns initially from city halls is paths. These paths will infinitely go right from where they spawned based on in-game demand for members or structures. 

When a new tile of terrain is generated based on demand, if it is a tile for a structure rather than a path, then it will contain “trees”. These trees can then be converted into paper in a factory, sold as blank sheet music to content shopping centers and then those shopping centers sell blank sheet music to Record Labels to create sheet music. 

Then, thanks when it’s turned into demo recordings and tracks for the projects and eras. 

Then data center structures pop up to store the content

`“What is Record Label Simulator (RLS)?”`

`Record Label Simulator (RLS) is a music-industry simulation game built on a very specific premise: the game is a database, and gameplay is the act of operating that database. Instead of treating “data” as something hidden behind a traditional game, RLS puts the data model at the center of the experience. Every meaningful thing the player interacts with is an entity (a row), with defined fields (cells), and rules that govern what can happen next. The intended result is a game that feels like you’re running a record label with the clarity and auditability of an admin console—because you are.`

`At the highest level, RLS is about building outcomes in a music ecosystem: signing talent, producing releases, choosing promotion, navigating trends, and competing for public-facing status signals like charts and records. But the distinctive design goal is that the system should remain deterministic and inspectable. If something happens—an Act rises, a Project underperforms, a chart position shifts—the game should be able to tell you why in a way that is consistent, replayable, and rooted in explicit rules rather than vibes. That’s why the game’s “true” state is conceived as tables plus an append-only event log (a chronological list of actions). You don’t just “do stuff”; you perform verbs that append events, and the world state is the result of replaying those events.`

`This database-first approach also shapes how RLS is meant to be implemented and experienced. The core client is browser-first: TypeScript with Indexed Database (IndexedDB) for local persistence, with import and export support so a save is portable without requiring accounts early on. The user interface is not pretending to be a cozy role-playing game menu; it’s deliberately Markdown-first and console-like—table browsers, entity pages, event viewers, and warning surfaces for validation. When the player looks at a chart, it should read like a clean table. When something is invalid or inconsistent, the system should surface it as a constraint violation or warning rather than silently “fixing” it behind the scenes.`

`RLS also has an in-world framing that matters: it’s set in your universe (Gaia, with nations and regions), and the simulation includes cultural infrastructure beyond just music files. There are Record Labels, Acts, Creators, Tracks and Projects, Broadcast programs, critics and councils, awards organizations, and a social layer (eyeriSocial) that can act as a visibility and narrative engine. Importantly, these aren’t just flavor nouns; the intent is that they become modelable entities with rules, dependencies, and outputs. The player is not a disembodied god-menu either: the player is a single character who occupies both a role layer (Chief Executive Officer) and an occupation layer (music executive). That dual framing exists so the game can justify “objectives” (like CEO Directives) while still making the day-to-day work feel like label operations rather than abstract questing.`

`The way RLS connects creative intent to simulation is also central to what it “is.” Content is not just “a song.” Content has classification, lifecycle, and consequences. Theme and Mood combine into a content genre label (“{theme} but it’s {mood}”), which then interacts with audience preferences, trends, critic reactions, and chart performance. The point is to make creative direction legible as data without stripping it of meaning: you can still have eras with narrative concepts, but those concepts need handles in the system so they can drive outcomes.`

`Because RLS is designed to be carried across chats and docs without drifting, process is part of what the game “is,” too. Your canon lives in Google Drive; the chat is coordination and drafting; and decisions become canon only when explicitly locked. Deprecated terms are treated as noise (with the special-case rule that older “Networks” wording should be interpreted as “Record Labels” while being flagged for cleanup). Even the way you maintain continuity—compound logs, append-only deltas, and reproducible drive-wide terminology migrations—reflects the same philosophy: the project should be auditable and repeatable, not reliant on memory or improvisation.`

`Put plainly: Record Label Simulator is a record label management game where depth comes from a structured world model instead of hidden spreadsheets, and where progress is built from logged actions instead of hand-waved simulation. It aims to satisfy the kind of player who wants to see the receipts—why a release worked, why an era hit, why a niche got incentivized, why a chart moved—without needing to trust the game on vibes.`

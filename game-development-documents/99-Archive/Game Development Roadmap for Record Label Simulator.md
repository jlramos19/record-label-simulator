# **`Internal Development Phase:`**

1. `Refine Game Design Document: Review and update your game design document based on the discussions and updates we've covered. Ensure that all aspects of the game mechanics, trends, decision-making, and entities are well-defined.`  
   2. `Complete Core Mechanics: Focus on implementing the core mechanics of the game, including the 60s loop, decision-making framework, trend system, Fusion Profile, and entity interactions.`  
   3. `Develop User Interface (UI): Design and create the user interface elements that players will interact with, including buttons, cards, trend indicators, and visual feedback elements.`  
   4. `Implement Gameplay Logic: Code the logic that drives the gameplay, such as how decisions affect trends, how Fusion Profile influences gameplay, and how player choices impact FLAMP factors.`  
   5. `Create Visual Assets: Work on creating visual assets, such as character avatars, badge icons, sticker designs, and labels that represent the Fusion Profile and personality traits.`  
   6. `Integrate Audio Elements: Incorporate audio elements into the game, including music samples, sound effects, and voiceovers.`

   # **`Internal Testing Phase:`**

   1. `Internal Playtesting: Have your development team playtest the game thoroughly to identify bugs, inconsistencies, and areas that need improvement. Collect their feedback on gameplay, mechanics, and user experience.`  
   2. `Refine Gameplay Balance: Use the feedback from internal playtesting to adjust the balance of the game, including the impact of decisions on trends and FLAMP factors.`  
   3. `Bug Fixing: Address any bugs, glitches, or technical issues that arise during internal playtesting.`  
   4. `Optimize User Interface: Make improvements to the user interface based on usability feedback from the internal playtesting phase.`  
   5. `Polish Visuals and Audio: Refine visual elements and audio components to ensure they align with the overall aesthetic and enhance the player experience.`

   # **`Closed Beta Phase:`**

   1. `Recruit Closed Beta Testers: Identify a group of players from your Label or through recruitment platforms who are interested in tycoon and strategy games.`  
   2. `Distribute Closed Beta Build: Provide closed beta testers with access to a build of the game that includes the core mechanics, decision-making, trends, and interactions.`  
   3. `Gather Feedback: Encourage closed beta testers to play the game and provide detailed feedback on their experiences, including gameplay, mechanics, visuals, and audio.`  
   4. `Analyze User Data: Gather data on player behavior and decisions within the game to identify trends and patterns.`  
   5. `Iterate Based on Feedback: Use the feedback collected from closed beta testers to make further refinements to gameplay, mechanics, balance, user interface, and overall player experience.`  
   6. `Final Bug Fixing: Address any remaining bugs, glitches, or issues identified during the closed beta testing phase.`  
   7. `Preparation for Public Release: Based on the feedback and improvements from the closed beta phase, prepare the game for a wider public release by addressing any last-minute adjustments or improvements.`

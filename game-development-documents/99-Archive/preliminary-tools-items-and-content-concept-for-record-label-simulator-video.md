`- **Moody Studio Recording Microphone** is used by **Recorders** to imbue demo recordings with particular moods, like uplifting or saddening, which impact the emotional delivery of the song being recorded.`  
`- **Fusion Computer** is operated by **Producers** to refine the theme and mood of a demo recording during the production process, thus finalizing the content genre of the track and influencing its quality, as determined by the in-game critics.`

`### Items:`  
`Items are the tangible products within the game created using the aforementioned tools:`

`- **Sheet Music** is an item crafted by songwriters using the Themed Bullet Pen; it represents the foundational compositional element of a song, grounded in specific themes.`

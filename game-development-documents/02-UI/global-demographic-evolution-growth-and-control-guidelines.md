Below is the original “Game Population Dynamics” document with an added section clarifying why population adjustments and evaluations occur on a yearly cycle. The newly inserted content appears in the “Post-3000 Controls” and in a brief explanatory note after the milestones.

### **Global Demographic Evolution: Growth and Control Guidelines**

**Overview:**  
 This document provides a comprehensive overview of the population growth mechanics and demographic management systems in Record Label simulator. Populations evolve from 1 million survivors in 2025 to multiple billions by the year 4000\. Guided solely by the game’s economy, countries, and the overarching eyeriS infrastructure, demographic changes unfold through carefully managed birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates—no direct player intervention is involved.

### **Population Growth Milestones**

#### **2025 \- The Starting Point**

* **Initial Conditions:**  
  * Global Population: \~1 million survivors  
  * Distribution: Equally split among Annglora, Bytenza, and Crowlya

#### **2025 to 2100 \- Rebuilding Civilization**

* **Population Range:** \~1 million to \~1 billion by 2100  
* **Ideal Target by 2100:** \~1 billion (tolerable: 750 million to 1.25 billion)  
* **Focus:**  
   Basic demographic controls restore stable societies. Economic factors ensure birth/death rates and migration push the global total toward sustainable numbers.

#### **2100 to 2200 \- Establishing New Order**

* **Population Range:** \~1 billion to \~5 billion by 2200  
* **Ideal Target by 2200:** \~5 billion (tolerable: 2.5 billion to 7.5 billion)  
* **Refined Controls:**  
   With more complex economies, countries and eyeriS manage resource distribution, subtly influencing demographic indicators so populations neither spike nor slump uncontrollably.

#### **2200 to 3000 \- Stabilizing Growth**

* **Population Range:** \~5 billion to \~10 billion by 3000  
* **Population Limits by 3000:** \~10 billion ideal (7.5 to 12.5 billion tolerable)  
* **Sustainable Equilibrium:**  
   Well-established infrastructures let demographic factors auto-correct as conditions vary, maintaining a balanced global population.

#### **3000 to 4000 \- Navigating the Future (±3% Adjustments)**

* **Population Fluctuation:** Between \~7.5 billion and 12.5 billion globally

* **Post-3000 Controls:**  
   After 3000, advanced systems ensure global populations remain within a ±3% adjustment range every evaluation period. These evaluations occur at defined intervals—specifically every year—to match the natural lifecycle brackets (age groups, reproductive windows, and generational shifts) that structure how Audience Chunks and demographic properties evolve. By aligning demographic checks with these yearly cycles, the simulation can:

  * Reassess birth and death rates as Age Groups advance through their life stages.  
  * Update life expectancy brackets, ensuring older Chunks phase out smoothly.  
  * Adjust budgets, engagement, and reproduction rates as Chunks move through yearly age categories.  
  * Refine immigration/emigration patterns to keep regions stable without sudden shocks.

This periodic approach ensures that demographic fine-tuning happens regularly, reflecting societal changes as generations mature, economic conditions shift, and natural fluctuations in population occur. The outcome is a population that remains stable and coherent, always adjusting gently to remain within set bounds.

### **Factors Influencing Population Dynamics**

* **Birth and Death Rates:**  
   Driven by the global economy, resource availability, and infrastructural support. Evaluated yearly to synchronize with age transitions and life expectancy changes.

* **Wars, Conflicts, and Disasters:**  
   Events cause temporary dips or surges in certain regions. The system uses the next yearly assessment to restore balance.

* **Migration (Economy-Driven):**  
   Immigration and emigration adapt as regions grow more or less hospitable. Yearly re-evaluations ensure these flows consistently realign population distribution toward sustainable targets.

### **Developer Notes**

1. **Yearly Evaluations:**  
    The choice of a yearly cycle is key. It matches the Age Group segmentation that underpins many demographic properties. At these regular intervals, the game adjusts critical factors—birth, death, migration—to keep population levels within the intended ranges.

2. **Algorithmic Stability and Testing:**  
    Ensure the demographic recalculations are stable and predictable at each yearly interval. Validate that no major event causes irreparable imbalance, thanks to these scheduled corrections.

### **Conclusion**

From the initial rebuilding period to the far future, population levels are guided by an interplay of economy-driven policies, infrastructural capacity, and subtle rate adjustments. Yearly evaluations serve as the backbone of these demographics, providing a consistent, logical, and manageable framework for ensuring that global population growth remains stable, dynamic, and believable without direct player intervention.

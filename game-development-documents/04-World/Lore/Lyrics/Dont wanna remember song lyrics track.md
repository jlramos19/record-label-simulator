`Don’t Wanna Remember`

`[first verse]`  
`I don’t wanna have to remember`  
`Everything that happened to me`  
`I hate that it’s cold in November`  
`It brings back the worst memories`

`[first pre-chorus]`  
`Winter is not even here yet`  
`Why are my eyes already wet?`

`[chorus]`  
`I bored you out, of that I'm sure,`  
`But piece by piece, you made me whole,`  
`Then cut me off, don’t know what for,`  
`I still crave peace, but want your call`

`[second verse]`  
`I don’t wanna have to remember`  
`You no longer want to see me`  
`I hate that it snows in November`  
`I can feel my lungs as they freeze`

`[second pre-chorus]`  
`When it’s over I’ll be okay`   
`I hate that I can’t see the day`

`[chorus]`  
`I bored you out, of that I'm sure,`  
`But piece by piece, you made me whole,`  
`Then cut me off, don’t know what for,`  
`I still crave peace, but want your call`

`[bridge]`

`The laughs, the screams, the way you breathed`

`I heard it all, it made me seethe`

`I couldn’t read between the lines`

`I could no longer make you mine`

`I saw you pretend to be happy`

`And you would talk to everybody`

`How immature of you, you brought me`

`You claim to see it all, but not me`

`[Verse]`

`I had to make a choice`

`To be no longer yours`

`I let go of myself`

`I couldn’t say it well`

`[Prechorus]`

`Something inside me always knew`

`I couldn’t make it through with you`

`[Chorus]`

`I stand still cause I can’t go back`

`I do wish I could change all that`

`I stand still cause I can’t move on`

`I do wish you’d want to hold on`

`[Postchorus]`

`To me`

`To me`

`Hold me like our first summer together`

`Don’t leave`

`Don’t leave`

`We can’t work through this but don’t surrender`

`[Verse]`

`I heard it in your voice`

`I thought that it was gross`

`Couldn’t believe myself`

`That you put me through hell`

`[Prechorus]`

`Something inside me always knew (always knew)`

`I couldn’t make it through with you (through with you)`

`[Chorus]`

`I stand still cause I can’t go back`

`I do wish I could change all that`

`I stand still cause I can’t move on`

`I do wish you’d want to hold on`

`[Postchorus]`

`To me (to me)`

`To me (to me)`

`Hold me like our first summer together`

`Don’t leave (don’t leave)`

`Don’t leave (don’t leave)`

`We can’t work through this but don’t surrender`

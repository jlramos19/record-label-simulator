Out of Boredom

\[Knock on door from outside\]

\[Shocked and Sad, Verse 1\]  
If you chose to sleep... in another room  
Why do you come into mine?  
It’s to check on me... just to know we’re cool  
And to wish me a goodnight

\[Pre-Chorus\]

We didn’t even do this when we were together 

What makes you think that faking it will make it better 

\[Chorus\]

Don’t come in again

Every night just makes it worse

I can’t take it when

You deny us with your words

\[Verse 2\]

You try to come in but it’s not to spoon

I don’t know what’s on your mind

I locked myself in before your perfume 

Left a scent of you behind

\[Confrontional Pre-Chorus\]  
You can’t get mad at me cause we are not together  
You keep knocking and say that you forgot your sweater

\[Chorus\]

Don’t come in again, Don’t come in again

Every night just makes it worse

I can’t take it when, I can’t take it when

You deny us with your words

\[Bridge\]

Tonight I won’t let you in

I made sure to check around

I took my mind for a spin

I bet you won’t be allowed

My patience is running thin

I don’t want to mess about

Whatever you are doing

I would rather you keep out

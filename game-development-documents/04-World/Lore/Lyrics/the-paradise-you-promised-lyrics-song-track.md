# **`the paradise you promised - lyrics song track`**

`The paradise you promised,`  
`Was once a dream of mine.`  
`I swear I'm being honest,`  
`And swear you will be fine.`

`You seem to be so modest,`  
`I wish that was my life.`  
`They say that I'm the hottest,`  
`But I just love your eyes.`

`What if I shared with you,`  
`The reason I'm so sad?`  
`Could I affect your view,`  
`Would listening make you mad?`

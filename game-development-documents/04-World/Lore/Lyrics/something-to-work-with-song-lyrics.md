`Something to Work With`

`[Intro]`  
`Maybe if I made it easier`  
`We could get it figured out`   
`I will just blow you a kiss and there`  
`We could get it figured out`

`[Verse]`  
`It’s never gonna end, is it?`  
`We’re never gonna change, will we?`  
`Can you at least pretend, will you?`  
`Or is this just a game… to lose?`

`[Pre-chorus]`  
`You don’t even hesitate`  
`I don’t even see you flinch`  
`You’re leaving a sour taste`  
`You don’t even wanna think`

`[Chorus]`  
`Speak up for once`  
`Give me an ounce of the passion you once gave me`   
`What do you want`  
`Kill me or leave just the part you still want in me`  
`Beg me to stay`  
`Tell me you really do wish I would stay in here`  
`I know you may`  
`I know we can work it out until May is here`

`[Post-chorus]`  
`Give me something to work with`  
`I can’t even get mad at you the right way`  
`Anything just to work with`  
`I can see you keeping your feelings at bay`

`[Bridge]`  
`Don’t make it hurt`  
`Or do`  
`Do make it hurt`  
`But choose`

`[Chorus]`   
`Speak up for once`   
`Give me an ounce of the passion you once gave me`   
`What do you want`   
`Kill me or leave just the part you still want in me`   
`Beg me to stay`   
`Tell me you really do wish I would stay in here`   
`I know you may`   
`I know we can work it out until May is here`

`[Post-chorus]`   
`Give me something to work with`   
`I can’t even get mad at you the right way`   
`Anything just to work with`   
`I can see you keeping your feelings at bay`

`[Outro]`  
`You make it hurt`  
`You do`

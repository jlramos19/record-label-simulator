`[Intro]`  
`I said I do know but I don’t know`   
`I said I do know but I don’t know` 

`[Verse]`  
`She swears she’s causing trouble, I fear she’s not`  
`‘Cause she thinks she knows my secret and they don’t`  
`But I sprayed it on the wall with neon green paint`

`[Prechorus]`  
`Oh baby now you see`  
`It’s no longer discreet`  
`I’m loud and then you cry and it fits` 

`[Chorus]`  
`Don’t you know that`  
`Everybody knows that`  
`Oh yeah, I said it`  
`I already chose that`  
`You can’t tell my secret`  
`I own the megaphone`

`[Postchorus]`  
`Don’t you know that`   
`Everybody knows that`  
`So save your two cents and leave me alone`

`[Verse 2]`  
`She keeps receipts like they’re bars of gold`  
`But my story’s out there no longer untold`   
`I wear it like a crown ‘cause the truth’s been told` 

`[Prechorus]`  
`Oh darling try again`  
`This game you’ll never win`  
`Can’t help but have a laugh when you fail`

`[Chorus]`  
`Don’t you know that`  
`Everybody knows that`  
`Oh yeah, I said it`  
`I already chose that`  
`You can’t tell my secret`  
`I own the megaphone`

`[Postchorus]`  
`Don’t you know that`   
`Everybody knows that`  
`So save your two cents and leave me alone`

`[Outro]`  
`I said I do know but I don’t know`   
`I said I do know but I don’t know` 

`I said I do know but I don’t know`   
`I’m loud and then you cry and it fits`

`I said I do know but I don’t know`

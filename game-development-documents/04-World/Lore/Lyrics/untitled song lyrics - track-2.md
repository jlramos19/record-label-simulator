I wish I could pretend I’ve moved on, I think you have, you’ve said you have, you said you don’t love or hate me, but I still love you  
I hate to have to involve others in our matters when you’re unresponsive  
I wish we could sort this out on our own, and close this chapter once and for all, but you keep making it difficult for us,  
And I hate to have to blame you, because I try to not assign blame, but there’s times when I have to face reality  
And realize there’s a lot more you could’ve done, a lot more you know you could’ve done too  
You said you gave it your all, you try to convince me it was for the better and that you’re better now  
But the slight glimpse I get into your life, show me you continue to lie  
So maybe it was for the better after all, because you know I would’ve never given up  
So you had to give up first for the sake of the two of us  
And that’s why I still love you, and I feel like I could never hate you

\[Verse 1\]

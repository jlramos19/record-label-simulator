I’m being sent back home  
I know you don’t believe me but you’re wrong  
Why did you entertain this for this long  
I’m sure you knew we’d inevitably come undone  
So why did you bring me home

Don’t tell me you’ve moved on  
Just yesterday you told me I’m the one  
Don’t tell me that all of your love is gone  
You know I don’t believe even a word  
So why don’t you go alone

I need to think  
Was hunting me not enough of a thrill?  
I told you hey please don’t rush, but you will

He Dances On

\[Beautiful acoustic guitar intro\]

\[Verse\]

Just looked at his side profile; it calls his attention

Often, his brain tries, but he’s the one his heart mentions 

So he sees him, and he puts his rose-colored lenses on

He plays songs he likes, then makes them loud as he dances on

\[Chorus\]

And he dances on and on

As the world around him crumbles, he just dances on

He builds fences up and up

And he won’t allow nobody in, he dances on

\[Even Livelier Acoustic Guitar\]

\[fade out\]

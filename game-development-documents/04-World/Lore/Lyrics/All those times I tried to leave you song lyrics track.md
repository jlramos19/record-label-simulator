`All those times I tried to leave you,`

`I just wanted you to change.`

`And I can’t help but understand you,`

`When you say it was a waste.`

`I feel foolish thinking ‘bout you,`

`I don’t know what to expect.`

`And I know that I have failed you,`

`Always seeking to perfect`

`Situations with no bones`

`And I think “I should’ve known,”`

`Was convinced that I was strong,`

`You’re the only one I wanted to hold.`

`We observe it in the past,`

`Though I don’t think that you do,`

`You seemed to move on too fast,`

`But I know you always knew.`

`I think of the consequences,`

`Lost it to white picket fences,`

`Thinking it would change our faces,`

`Looking at all these new places.`

`Doesn’t seem easy to me,`

`You pretend you didn’t care,`

`Yet, in your eyes, I could see,`

`That excited and bright glare.`

`Why did you still hug me tight?`

`When we know it’s over,`

`She told me it wasn’t right,`

`…I will disappoint her.`

`I can’t say no to your kisses,`

`You’re no longer offering them,`

`This thing feels just like a thesis,`

`And I don’t think I’ll pass the test.`

`Getting over you seems possible,`

`At least on paper, and that’s that,`

`And I make myself responsible,`

`I pushed you away just like that.`

`Did I really try to help you?`

`I think I wanted myself cloned,`

`You were ice; I tried to melt you,`

`But you went back to the same form.`

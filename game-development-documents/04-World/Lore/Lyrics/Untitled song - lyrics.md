\[verse 1\]  
I think of you and then think to myself  
Why is it that we give each other hell?  
Why is it that you told me that you lied  
When you were done pretending you were mine?

\[prechorus\]  
Somehow I’m still in love  
No matter for how long  
Your absence just means nothing  
In my mind we’re still something

\[chorus\]  
And how do I convince myself that I’m not still in love?  
You’re still the icon since I fell like you too fell before

\[post chorus\]  
It’s such a shame  
 I never got back up and I don’t want to  
And it’s so lame  
 you don’t seem to lack flubs but you don’t have to

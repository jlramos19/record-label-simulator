`In this space`

`Only my thoughts I can view`

`In your face`

`I can see the thought of you`

`It’s not just an emotion`

`Or like some twisted faith`

`You set my heart in motion`

`Then punch me in the face` 

`would I share`

`My darkest secrets with you`

`Is this the place`

`Where we discover something new`

`Does he love me`

`Does he love me not`

`It feels like you’re crushing my bones`

`And like you won’t stop throwing stones` 

`This loving will hurt like a gunshot`

`But hating will get me a mugshot`

`I get angry at myself`  
`For shit I can't control`  
`Red flags that I ignored`  
`For opening the door`  
` `  
`There's just so much I can say`  
`The fucked up shit I’m told`  
`I'm expected to hold`  
`Like I'm some sort of gnome`  
` `  
`And I can't even pray`  
`From me that tool they stole`  
` `  
` `  
` `

`[Verse]`  
`The scent of your perfume hits me right now,`  
`I know you did not mean it, but I see how,`  
`How your face looks like it was carved by the gods,`   
`Swear it drives me so crazy that I forgot`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`That I miss...`  
`That I wish...`  
`That I could see it all more clearly.`

`And I did...`  
`I believed...`  
`Couldn't know what went wrong, for real, yeah.`

`[Chorus]`  
`And we could make it last forever.`  
`Was a fool, I can see it better.`  
`All my plans fade out, I forget her.`  
`I wish I had sent you that letter.`

`[Post-Chorus]`  
`Uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`  
`Uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`  
`Uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`  
`Uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`

`[Verse]`  
`I gotta forget you, I don't know how.`  
`While the fire from our memories won't leave, I vow.`  
`That I meant it, I still wanna see you 'round`  
`But it's late, you're unwell, so I tell you ciao.`

`[Bridge]`  
`Part of me...`  
`Wants to think...`  
`That you once loved me like I mean it.`

`Was a risk...`  
`Late I'll be...`  
`To the end we both saw, I'll be there.`

`[Outro]`  
`Uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`  
`Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`  
`Uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`  
`Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.`

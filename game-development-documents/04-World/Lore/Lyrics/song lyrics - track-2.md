\[Verse 1\]  
The dullness that comes  
from overanalyzing  
This situation over  
and over again

I’m sure you’re sure  
I wasn’t realizing  
We were so over  
That shit sounds so gay

\[Pre-Chorus\]  
I just thought, “I didn't know you that well”  
In my head, wasn’t possible for you to leave  
I just lost my grip, can’t get out of bed  
Know I led myself through it, now I hate it here

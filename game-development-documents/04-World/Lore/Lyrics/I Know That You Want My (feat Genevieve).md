`[Chorus – Marc]`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my`

`[Verse – Genevieve]`  
`Turn on your five senses`  
`Boy let’s go for more`  
`I know that you’ve been there`  
`Let’s go and explore`

`[Pre-Chorus – Marc]`  
`Don’t you rush it`  
`We have time`  
`We both crush it`  
`Don’t standby`

`[Chorus – Marc]`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my`

`[Post-Chorus – Genevieve]`  
`Body stripped down`  
`Skin and bones`  
`Clothes all ripped off`  
`We’re not done`

`[Bridge – Genevieve]`  
`Our heartbeats are linked`  
`We enjoy the heat`  
`Stuck to me like lint`  
`Full under the sheets`

`[Chorus – Marc]`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my body`  
`I know that you want my`

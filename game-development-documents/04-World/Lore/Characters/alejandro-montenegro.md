# **Record Label Simulator RLS — Alejandro Montenegro**

Alejandro Montenegro is one of Gaia’s most influential music executives, hailing from the nation of Crowlya. Renowned for his calculated strategies and refined persona, Montenegro blends a legacy of family leadership with his own brand of precision and innovation.

## **Background**

Born into the Hann-Montenegro lineage, Alejandro serves as both mentor and uncle to Marc Hann, guiding him within the record label world. He represents a bridge between Crowlya’s cultural traditions and the modern ambitions of its rising generation.

## **Role in RLS**

Montenegro is the CEO of Blackmount Record Label, based in Bytenza. His leadership emphasizes access to premier resources and his slogan, “I Have Access to the Finest Goods,” reflects his obsession with quality and Alignment. He frequently appears in executive-level narratives and quests, offering counsel and shaping label diplomacy.

## **Beliefs and Persona**

Montenegro values precision, efficiency, and innovation. He maintains an image of calm control, yet shows a wary awareness of Crowlya’s darker myths, particularly the entity known as AKITO. His outlook partially resonates with both goddesses of Annglora: Lumiora’s cultivation and Daethora’s intensity.

## **Public Image vs. Reality**

Montenegro paints himself as an activist, projecting the image of a socially conscious leader committed to cultural progress. However, this is a crafted persona. In truth, he is a venture capitalist who inherited a vast fortune from his grandfather. His activism is a branding strategy that masks his reliance on capital, access, and financial influence to expand his power. This duality makes him a polarizing figure in Gaia’s cultural landscape: admired by some as a reformer, criticized by others as opportunistic.

## **Narrative Impact**

Montenegro influences multiple storylines in Record Label Simulator RLS, acting as both a stabilizer and disruptor. His mentorship to Marc Hann creates family-driven narrative arcs, while his capitalist power and cultivated activist image allow him to manipulate both audiences and industry politics. He embodies the tension between idealism and pragmatism.

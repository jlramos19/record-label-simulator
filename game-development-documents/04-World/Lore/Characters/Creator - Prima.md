The term "prima donna" originally comes from Italian opera, where it was used to designate the leading female singer in an opera company, the one who played the main roles. The literal translation of "prima donna" is "first lady." Over time, the term has evolved and is now used more broadly to describe someone who considers themselves more important than others, often displaying high levels of arrogance, demandingness, or sensitivity to criticism. This usage implies a negative perception of the person's behavior, suggesting they are difficult to work with or require special treatment.

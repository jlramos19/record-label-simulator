# **`Game Concept: Capital City Tile Layouts`**

*`Detailed Breakdown of City Tiles in Record Label Simulator`*

---

## **`Overview`**

`The game world in Record Label Simulator features three distinct Capital Cities, each representing one of the game's nations. Each city is designed using a 3x3 grid layout, where every tile is named after its position relative to the city's center and adheres to the naming convention {Direction} {City Name}. These tiles function as Areas, supporting the placement of Structures, Trees, or Paths.`

`Additionally, there is an Elsewhere Region, identified as Tile 0, representing abstract regions beyond the visible cities.`

`The cities include:`

1. **`Bloomville`**`, Capital City of Annglora`  
2. **`Belltown`**`, Capital City of Bytenza`  
3. **`Campana City`**`, Capital City of Crowlya`

`Each tile serves a unique functional role while maintaining clarity and immersion through consistent naming.`

## **`0. Elsewhere Region`**

* **`Tile Number`**`: 0`  
* **`Description`**`: Represents the abstract regions outside the visible cities. These regions simulate Audience Chunks that influence global trends in content consumption, without direct player interaction.`

## **`Game Design Considerations`**

1. **`Tile Purpose`**`:`

   * `Each tile represents an Area that can support:`  
     * **`Structures`**`: Studios, Factories, Residences, Venues, etc.`  
     * **`Paths`**`: For connectivity between Structures.`  
     * **`Trees`**`: As a natural resource for paper production.`  
2. **`Central Tile`**`:`

   * `Each city's Center Tile hosts the City Hall.`  
   * `The City Hall is critical for spawning Community Members into the city.`  
3. **`Elsewhere Region`**`:`

   * `Tile 0 simulates global Audience Chunks, influencing trends and preferences without requiring physical Structures or visual representation.`  
4. **`Naming Convention`**`:`

   * `All tiles follow the format: {Direction} {City Name}.`  
   * `Example: North Bloomville, Northwest Belltown, Central Campana City.`  
5. **`Immersion and Clarity`**`:`

   * `Using full city names ensures consistency and immersion, reinforcing the game's world-building and lore.`

---

## **`Summary`**

`Each Capital City in Record Label Simulator is composed of a 3x3 grid layout of tiles, with each tile functioning as an Area. Additionally, the Elsewhere Region (Tile 0) abstracts audience behaviors and trends. This layout provides a clear and logical structure for managing the game's population, content creation, and economic systems. The naming convention ensures clarity and immersion, setting a strong foundation for player interaction and strategic gameplay.`

* **`Bloomville`**`, Capital City of Annglora`  
* **`Belltown`**`, Capital City of Bytenza`  
* **`Campana City`**`, Capital City of Crowlya`  
* **`Elsewhere Region (Tile 0)`** `for global simulation of Audience Chunks.`

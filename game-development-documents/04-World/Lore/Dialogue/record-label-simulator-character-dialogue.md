– “There’s nothing to suffocate about, don’t lose your breath.”  
– “What do you mean? That was great\!”  
– “I know why I’m telling you this. Pay attention.”  
– “I mean- I don’t know, man. I just…”  
– “Say it. You’re captivated. Allured even\! But, trust me, it won’t last.”

– “...above me? Because you’re not. You may be older, but that’s all. You’re not entitled to being right all the time just because you’ve lived longer than me.”  
– “This attitude is going to cost you, kid.”  
– “I can pay the price. I think we should wrap up this conversation.”  
– “Now, that’s something I can agree with.”  
– “Goodbye, Mr. Montenegro.”  
– “Bye, son.”  
– “Oh, so now I’m ‘son’?”  
– “Could you just-? You know what? How about we listen to your advice? I have things to do anyway.”  
– “You- …okay. Let me just-”  
– “...yeah…”

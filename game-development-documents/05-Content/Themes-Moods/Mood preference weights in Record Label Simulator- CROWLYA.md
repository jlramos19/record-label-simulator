### **`Interpretation (Crowlya culture → what content works)`**

* **`daring + thrilling`** `sit at the top because Crowlya is the clearest “Risky payoff” market, and your docs explicitly call out Daring-based success there.`

* **`energizing + uplifting`** `stay mid-high because Crowlya can still reward “regal victory” and spectacle (big wins, dominance, ascendancy), not just darkness.`

* **`calming`** `is intentionally not low because Crowlya’s mysticism supports ritual/awe “stillness” when it feels powerful rather than soft.`

* **`angering`** `is moderate: confrontation can fuel Risky arcs, but it’s not the only engine (Crowlya is more “bold” than purely “mad”).`

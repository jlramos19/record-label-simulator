  
I may — fuck up to then  
Tell you I was wrong 

You’re ex—hausted, you’ve been  
working all day long

And you’re— thinking in bed  
things will feel like home 

But I —still give you hell   
you wish you were gone

\[pre-chorus\]  
But I sit here all alone  
I feel as dry as a bone  
And while there’s nothing to do  
All I can do is think of you

\[chorus\]  
And I try to help you so you help us  
But you all you do is further break us  
We know the truth, you won’t change for us  
But to find someone new, pass the test, boss

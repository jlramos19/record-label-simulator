# **Evolution of the Project’s Name**

## **Phase 1 — Topoda Charts**

Original Use: The earliest working title for the game itself.

Status Now: No longer the name of the game.

Current Role: Topoda Charts has been repurposed as the development company’s name, preserving its legacy while distinguishing it from the product.

## **Phase 2 — Record Label Simulator RLS**

Context: Adopted after refining the scope of the project. It clearly identifies the player’s role and core gameplay loop—running a record label.

Status Now: Final and canon name of the game.

Acronym: Always referred to as RLS in all documentation and in-game references.

## **Summary**

• The game went through three identity drafts before settling on RLS (Record Label Simulator).

• Topoda Charts, once the prototype name of the game, has been reclaimed as the official name of the developing company.

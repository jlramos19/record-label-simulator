Acts Game Loop in Record Label Simulator

- Acts operate through Eras. An Era can be started manually from the Era Desk or auto-started when a track is scheduled/released.
- Era stages: Direction, Creation, Promotion, Legacy.
- Rollout templates define stage length:
  - Sprint: 1 / 2 / 2 / 1 weeks
  - Standard: 2 / 2 / 2 / 2 weeks
  - Longform: 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 weeks
- Weekly updates advance the current stage week; when stages complete, the Era is archived.
- Multiple Eras can run concurrently across Acts; a focused Era drives UI targeting for promotions.

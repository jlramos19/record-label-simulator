# **`Record Label Simulator - Creators Community Chamber (Structure)`**

## **`Purpose`**

`The Creators Community Chamber (CCC) is a world-owned Structure where aspiring Members transition into Creators. It replaces legacy A&R interview mechanics. The CCC serves both as a signing hub for Record Labels and as a training institution that improves Members’ stamina and skills until they are signed.`

## **`Infobox - Structure`**

## **`Player Interactions`**

1. `Browse available Creator IDs (Members prepared by CCC).`  
2. `View ID metadata: occupation, Theme/Mood lean, Alignment tendency, stage name.`  
3. `Trigger signing flow (see How To Sign a Creator System).`  
4. `Outcomes: Accept → Creator joins Label; Reconsider → retry timer; Decline → ID returns to pool.`  
5. `eyeriSocial integration: signed/declined/reconsider events broadcast to Audience.`

## **`NPC Interactions`**

* `Members enroll in the CCC to receive stamina/skill training.`  
* `When ready, CCC presents them as Creator IDs to Record Labels.`  
* `Rejected IDs return to training until reconsideration, then re-enter pool.`

## **`Visuals`**

`The CCC uses capsule-to-ID animation when Members transition into Creators: a capsule opens, a card materializes, and the Creator’s avatar ID is generated.`

## **`Integration`**

* `Connects directly to How To Sign a Creator system (contract negotiation flow).`  
* `eyeriSocial posts about CCC outcomes (signed, declined, reconsidered).`  
* `Feeds into Trends and Charts as new Creators enter the world.`

## **`Telemetry`**

* `ccc_id, creator_id`  
* `attempts_count, accept/reconsider/decline outcome`  
* `timer_duration, eyeriSocial_post_id`

## **`Notes`**

`Legacy terms such as A&R interview as the primary mechanic are retired. The CCC is the canonical structure for Creator signings in RLS.`

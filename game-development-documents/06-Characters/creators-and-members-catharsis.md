`It seems like you're detailing a mechanic where members in your game 'Record Label Simulator' manage their catharsis points based on their activities and rest periods. Here’s a breakdown based on your explanation:`

`### Catharsis Depletion and Recharge Mechanics for Members`

`- **Activity Cycle**:`   
  `- Members operate on an 8-hour cycle: 8 hours for sleeping, working, and consuming content.`

`- **Catharsis Depletion**:`  
  `- Members deplete catharsis points during their activities, with a ratio of 3:2:1 (work:consume:sleep).`  
  `- This means for every 3 units of catharsis points depleted during work, they consume 2 units while consuming content, and 1 unit while sleeping.`

`- **Catharsis Recharge**:`  
  `- Catharsis points recharge during the sleep and work phases of the cycle:`  
    `- **Sleep**: Members recharge 1 unit of catharsis per 8 hours of sleep.`  
    `- **Work**: Members recharge 2 units of catharsis per 8 hours of work.`

`### Example Calculation:`  
`If a member depletes 300 catharsis points over an 8-hour cycle:`  
`- **Sleep**: Recharges 100 catharsis points (1 unit).`  
`- **Work**: Recharges 200 catharsis points (2 units).`

`This cycle ensures that members have opportunities to manage their emotional well-being while engaging in productive and leisure activities within your game's mechanics.`

`**Follow-up question**: How do you plan to balance the impact of members' catharsis levels on gameplay dynamics, such as their productivity in manufacturing, distributing, and selling activities?`

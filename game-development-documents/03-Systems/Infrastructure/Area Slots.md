The slots allow for IDs and Items to be equipped to an area.   
When clicking the slot, a panel will open showing the allowed IDs or Items that the player can put on said slot. If the player doesn’t own a type of item that is allowed and unlocked, it will show greyed out. If the item remains unlocked, it won’t show on the UI.

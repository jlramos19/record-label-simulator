`In your game, even unoccupied areas have a standardized address format that lacks certain details until developed or acquired. Initially, these areas include only the neighborhood, street name, and area number, reflecting their undeveloped status. As these areas are claimed and developed by a corporation or community member, the addresses become more specific, adding floor and unit numbers to reflect the new status of the property.`

`Example of a Full Address for an Unoccupied Area:`

* `Street Name: Placeholder St`  
* `Area Number: 0015`  
* `Neighborhood: Central Admin (since it holds the town hall)`  
* `City/Town: Bloomville`  
* `State: Audora`  
* `Country: Annglora`  
* `Postal Code: A000`

`In this format, "Central Admin" as the neighborhood name indicates the administrative significance, being the location of the city or town hall, which aligns with the special role assigned to '0' in your coding system. The address lacks a floor and unit number as it is still unoccupied and undeveloped.`

`Details:`  
`- the number of areas is assigned based on the radial distance from the center of the city/town hall.`   
`- after that, the circle rotates clockwise to assign the numbers.`   
`- streets are curved`

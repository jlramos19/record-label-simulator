# **`CEO 12 Requests — Annual Winners, Scoring, and No-Ties Policy (Gaia)`**

## **`Restating the purpose`**

`This document defines how the CEO’s 12 Requests (“of the year in Gaia” achievements) are evaluated each year, how winners are selected, and how ties are prevented and resolved so the question never resurfaces.`

---

## **`1) Scope and definitions`**

### **`1.1 Scope`**

* `These rules apply to all twelve CEO achievements (“Requests”).`

* `Each achievement is evaluated per calendar year in-game (a year has 12 months).`

* `The region scope is Gaia (the world), which consists of 3 countries.`

* `For each achievement, there is exactly one winner Act per year. No ties are allowed.`

### **`1.2 Entity: Act`**

* `“Winner” refers to an Act (not an individual Track/Project/Promo/Tour item).`

### **`1.3 Prohibition`**

* `Never break ties using chart position details (rank, peak, weeks-on-chart outside #1 counting, etc.).`

  * `Charts are used only for the primary “chart-topping” scoring, not for tie resolution.`

## **`2) The CEO’s 12 Requests (Achievements)`**

`Each year, there are 12 separate “of the year” winners, one per achievement category:`

### **`Tracks (3)`**

1. `Most chart-topping Track of the year (Gaia)`

2. `Best-selling / most-streamed Track of the year (Gaia)`

3. `Most awarded / critically acclaimed Track of the year (Gaia)`

### **`Projects (3)`**

4. `Most chart-topping Project of the year (Gaia)`

5. `Best-selling / most-streamed Project of the year (Gaia)`

6. `Most awarded / critically acclaimed Project of the year (Gaia)`

### **`Promotional Content (3)`**

7. `Most chart-topping Promotional Content of the year (Gaia)`

8. `Best-selling / most-watched Promotional Content of the year (Gaia)`

9. `Most awarded / critically acclaimed Promotional Content of the year (Gaia)`

### **`Tours (3)`**

10. `Most chart-topping Tour of the year (Gaia)`

11. `Best-selling / highest-attended Tour of the year (Gaia)`

12. `Most awarded / critically acclaimed Tour of the year (Gaia)`

## **`3) Primary scoring for “Most chart-topping … of the year”`**

### **`3.1 Core rule`**

`For “most chart-topping … of the year” achievements, the winner is determined by #1 performance per week, using weighted scope points.`

### **`3.2 Weekly #1 point values (applied per week)`**

`For each week an Act holds #1, award points based on the scope of that #1:`

* `Regional #1 = 1 point per week`

* `National #1 = 2 points per week`

* `Global #1 = 3 points per week`

### **`3.3 Annual chart-topping score`**

* `For the calendar year, compute:`

`Chart-Topping Score (year) = Σ (weeks at #1 × scope points)`

* `Sum across all relevant regions/nations/global charts within Gaia for that year.`

* `The Act with the highest Chart-Topping Score wins that year’s “chart-topping” achievement.`

### **`3.4 Tie prevention intent`**

* `These weights exist so ties are unlikely “from the get go,” because not all #1s are equal value.`

---

## **`4) No-Ties policy (applies to all 12 achievements)`**

### **`4.1 Required outcome`**

* `For each achievement, per year, there must be exactly one winner Act.`

* `If a tie occurs at any stage, it must be resolved using the ladder below.`

* `The ladder is deterministic: use the first rule that breaks the tie and stop.`

### **`4.2 Tie-break ladder (global and year-bounded)`**

`If two or more Acts are tied for an achievement in that calendar year, resolve as follows:`

#### **`Step 1 — Sales/Streams (easiest, preferred)`**

* `Compare global total sales/streams for the tied Acts within that same year.`

* `Higher global total wins.`

`Notes:`

* `This is explicitly year-bounded and global because the purpose is to break the tie for that year.`

* `This also discourages “camping” positions and then plummeting off charts: sustained global volume matters.`

#### **`Step 2 — Critics (if still tied)`**

* `Compare Critical Acclaim Score using the same scope weights:`

  * `Regional = 1 point`

  * `National = 2 points`

  * `Global = 3 points`

* `Higher weighted critics outcome wins for that year.`

#### **`Step 3 — Awards (if still tied)`**

* `Compare Awards Score using the same scope weights:`

  * `Regional = 1 point`

  * `National = 2 points`

  * `Global = 3 points`

* `Higher weighted awards outcome wins for that year.`

#### **`Step 4 — First achieved (final failsafe)`**

`If there is ever a real tie after all of the above:`

* `The tie is broken by whoever achieved the goal first.`

* `“Achieved the goal first” means the tied Acts’ earliest in-game timestamp at which the yearly win condition is satisfied.`

* `Earliest timestamp wins.`

### **`4.3 Explicit prohibition restated`**

* `Never resolve ties by looking deeper into chart positions (rank details beyond #1 week scoring).`

* `Tie resolution is Sales/Streams → Critics → Awards → First Achieved, not chart position.`

---

## **`5) Summary of yearly evaluation flow`**

`For each calendar year:`

1. `Evaluate each of the 12 achievements independently.`

2. `Determine the top candidates using the achievement’s primary metric:`

   * `“Chart-topping” uses #1-week weighted points (Regional=1, National=2, Global=3).`

   * `Other achievements use their respective primary metric as defined by the game.`

3. `If there is a tie at the top, apply the tie-break ladder:`

   * `Global Sales/Streams (year)`

   * `Weighted Critics (year)`

   * `Weighted Awards (year)`

   * `First Achieved (earliest timestamp)`

4. `Record exactly one winner Act for that achievement for that year.`

---

## **`Conclusion`**

`The CEO’s 12 Requests are annual (12-month) Gaia-scoped achievements that always produce one winner Act per achievement per year. “Chart-topping” is scored by weekly #1 points (Regional=1, National=2, Global=3 per week). If any tie occurs anywhere, it is resolved deterministically—Sales/Streams first (global total for that year), then Critics, then Awards, and finally “First Achieved”—with an explicit rule that chart position details are never used to break ties.`

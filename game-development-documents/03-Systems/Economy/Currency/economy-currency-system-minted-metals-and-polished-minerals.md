`I've decided to create a unique economy around "minted metals" and "polished minerals." "Minted metals" are processed metals that have been stamped into standardized coins or currency units. These metals serve as the more affordable option in the game's economy, representing a readily available form of currency. On the other hand, we have "polished minerals." These are refined mineral resources that have been carefully cut and polished. These minerals are rarer and more valuable, making them the higher-priced currency in the game. They add a layer of prestige and uniqueness to the in-game transactions. By incorporating both minted metals and polished minerals, I'm aiming to create a dynamic and engaging economic system. Players will need to consider the value and rarity of each currency type when making decisions about trade, investments, and more.`

`## Terrain Generation Priority in Record Label Simulator`

`The new terrain is turned into either a road if needed or a lot if demand is high enough. In lots, structures spawn based also on demand. There are some sectors with specific organizations and structures. Organizations lease structures, the current structures leased by an organization determine the organization’s area in the map.` 

`For example, if there is enough content being produced and consumed, then the map will generate a new terrain, and if the “bank” of the country (affecting only the specific capital city the player plays on, like Bloomville, Annglora) has enough currency, it’ll turn it into a factory that produces more content for distribution. If the content produced is too much and can’t keep up with the manufacturing speed of the members of that occupation, then a content distribution center will need more members to distribute content faster to shopping and data centers. Data centers manage the current content available, once content is catalogued, then it will be turned back into sheet music for more new content to be created.` 

`Once members despawn (pass away in-game), all the content they purchased also gets turned back into sheet music for the production of new content.` 

`Critics get content distributed by the Record Label to rate content then it gets destroyed on the date that the content is either released or scrapped.`

This module describes the web time/calendar model. DateTime is stored as a numeric tick counter in app state (ms or hours since epoch). A timer loop advances ticks so that every 2.5 seconds of real time equals 1 in-game hour (configurable). The UI renders a formatted timestamp like "WED - JAN 01, 2200 - 12AM" while internal logs can include minutes/seconds for debugging. Persist time state in JSON via localStorage or IndexedDB, not binary serializers.

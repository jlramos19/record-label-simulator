## **Record Label Simulator — Simulation Timeline and Milestones**

### **Overview**

The simulation starts in **2025** to seed the world state. The **player begins gameplay in 2400**. The period **2400-3000** is the main objective window ("campaign"). After **3000**, gameplay continues in a freer, extended mode until the hard end cap at **9999**.

**Seeding rule (canon)**:
- **2025-2200** is a fixed, deterministic baseline across all runs.
- **2200-2400** is uniquely seeded per run (variable), and its result is what the player inherits at 2400.

### **Timeline**

#### **2025–2100 — Historical Simulation (World Seeding)**

* The simulation begins in **2025**.  
* This phase exists to generate the foundational world state before the player exists in the timeline.  
* **This period is deterministic and identical across runs.**
  * demographics and population evolution  
  * early cultural baselines  
  * long-run conditions that later affect music consumption and charts

**Milestone: 2100**

* Marks the end of the initial historical simulation block and the start of the next world-state checkpoint.

---

#### **2100–2200 — Charts History (Legacy Building)**

* This phase exists to create **chart history** and legacy context.  
* The world continues evolving, but the key output is a meaningful historical record of what charted and why.
* **This period is deterministic and identical across runs.**

**Milestone: 2200**

* Marks the end of the charts-history block and the transition into the final pre-player build-up.

---

#### **2200–2400 — Final Pre-Player Build-Up**

* The world continues evolving to reach the mature state that the player will inherit.  
* **This period is uniquely seeded per run (variable).**
* This phase closes the gap between “legacy exists” and “the modern simulation is ready for gameplay.”

**Milestone: 2400 (Player Commencement)**

* **Player gameplay begins at 2400\.**  
* This is the canonical start year used for the player-facing timeline and in-game date display.

---

#### **2400–3000 — Main Gameplay Window (Campaign)**

* This is the primary objective-driven era.  
* The player pursues the game’s main victory-condition framing (the CEO’s requests / major milestones) during this window.

**Milestone: 3000**

* Serves as the “main objectives deadline” boundary.  
* Reaching this point transitions gameplay into extended mode.

---

#### **3001–9999 — Extended Mode (Free Reign)**

* After year **3000**, gameplay continues with freer progression rules.  
* The simulation persists long-term as a sandbox/extended run.

**Milestone: 9999 (Hard End Cap)**

* The run ends at **9999**.

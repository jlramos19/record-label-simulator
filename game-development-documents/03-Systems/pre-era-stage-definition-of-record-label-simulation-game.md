Era Definition:  
An era in the game represents an artist's project cycle, which may include “single track” releases and a tour.

So, imagine this scenario and explain it as algorithmic steps:

The Player, as the Music Executive, is in charge of a Record Label. This Record Label has a CEO who provides the Player with Quests.

The Communities act as both the Audience and the pool of IDs available to be signed as Acts.

When Communities act as Audience, they are General Audience, with some specific hardcore fans considered Stans with three levels of engagement: Connoisseur, Buff, and Addict.

Auditions allow the Player to see which Community Members are interested in being Creators (IDs) of the Record Label.

Some Community Members are Independent and trying to make a name for themselves through eyeriSocial; they can be directly reached out to and offered a "deal" to sign them to the Record Label with a Contract.

The player can also sign Creators from these Communities by extending a Contract that includes an advance and a percentage of earnings from created content.

The Creators can then be assembled into Acts; the Player negotiates with the Creator after the conclusion of each Act to continue the contract, cancel it, or adjust it (upgrade it; the Record Label can never downgrade a contract. Instead, the act would leave the Record Label and the contract would be canceled)

If the Act wants an upgrade, the Creator will negotiate with the Player; it's up to the Player to accept the upgrade; if the upgrade is declined, the Catharsis of the Act will be affected either positively or negatively and fuel the creation of more content that will align with the creators' vision. As in, the drawback of not accepting an upgrade of a contract of an act is to give them more creative freedom, which might have unintended consequences for the Record Label.

When the Act is ready to create content, it can collaborate with other IDs of the Record Label or the other seven Record Labels in-game.

We're ready to create content once the Player starts an Era of an Act.

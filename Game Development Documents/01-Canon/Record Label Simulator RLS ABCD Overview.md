# **Record Label Simulator RLS ABC\&D Overview**

Host: Genevive Mar (legal name: Genevive Hann). Framing interviews with Marc Hann appear in key episodes.

## **Seasons and Format**

• Structure: 9 seasons × 9 episodes, plus 12 specials.  
• Runtime: 22 minutes per episode.  
• Template: Cold open → Series intro → Ideology definition → Concepts and uses → Country case studies (3) → Positive/negative effects → Risk assessment → Closing/Credits.

## **Economy Archetype Palette (for episodes)**

Shortlist used by ABC\&D to analyze countries and their arts ecosystems. Each archetype includes a one‑line RLS hook.

• Mixed Economy — Balanced public/private roles; moderated regulation. RLS hook: steady audience loyalty; strong long‑tail catalog.

• Market Capitalism — Private firms lead with regulation. RLS hook: high entrepreneurship; faster trend turnover.

• Corporate Control — Corporations align with or steer state policy. RLS hook: brand/label consolidation boosts promotion efficiency.

• State Control — Centralized authority directs ownership and policy. RLS hook: content gates and official content genres; underground niches emerge.

• Labeled Tech Commons — Citizen‑run digital infrastructure; minimal central authority. RLS hook: viral discovery; algorithm shocks and sudden spikes.

• Minimalist State — Light oversight; markets operate freely. RLS hook: export multipliers; cross‑border collabs gain mobility perks.

## **Country Mapping (recommended, toggle as needed)**

• Annglora → Mixed Economy (stable growth, daylight/serenity cultural tone).  
• Bytenza → Corporate Control (executive culture; big‑brand leverage and media buys).  
• Crowlya → State Control (mythic authority; approved content genres vs underground dissent).  
• D (official name TBD) → Labeled Tech Commons (high innovation; volatile discoverability). If a calmer option is desired, swap to Minimalist State.

## **Episode Data Connections (RLS systems)**

• Audience Chunks: adjust taste vectors by archetype (official vs underground; volatility).  
• Trends: volatility higher in Labeled Tech Commons; lower in Mixed Economy.  
• Alignment/Compliance: gates and bonuses based on archetype (e.g., censorship in State Control).  
• Labels/Strategy: M\&A bonus in Corporate Control; export multiplier in Minimalist State; catalog longevity in Mixed Economy.  
• Charts: tie import/export flows to national and international chart calculations.

## **Production Notes**

• Canon naming: use “Record Label Simulator RLS”; Topoda Charts is the development company, not the game title.  
• Document naming: avoid underscores; include full game name and the acronym RLS in file titles.  
• Legacy drafts: mark any remaining Topoda Charts videogame references as historical and link to the RLS canon doc.

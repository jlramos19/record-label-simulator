Hello, search the memory for the first, second, and third CI and follow the instructions of the first custom instruction first in the first message, after I confirm that you've done it correctly, and reply "Ok" (NOT 'continue'), you can move on to the second CI. Pay very close attention to the specific instructions of this message and execute them sequentially in different messages.

CI stands for custom instructions.

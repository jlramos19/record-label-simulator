### **`Economy - 30-70 Pricing Dynamic`**

`The 30-70 pricing dynamic in Record Label Simulator dictates that each additional track alternates between a $0.30 and $0.70 price increase. This system offers predictable escalation, ensuring that more extensive content justifies higher prices while remaining transparent and manageable.`

---

### **`1. Core Principle`**

**`Every new track`** `added to a project increases the price either by $0.30 or $0.70, alternating between these increments. This pattern enables strategic growth—Players can scale up content knowing precisely how much each additional track costs.`

---

### **`2. Practical Examples`**

**`EP Projects (4–7 tracks)`**

* `4 Tracks: $4.99`  
* `5 Tracks: $5.29 (+$0.30)`  
* `6 Tracks: $5.99 (+$0.70)`  
* `7 Tracks: $6.29 (+$0.30)`

**`LP Projects (8–30 tracks)`**

* `8 Tracks: $8.99`  
* `9 Tracks: $9.29 (+$0.30)`  
* `10 Tracks: $9.99 (+$0.70)`  
* `11 Tracks: $10.29 (+$0.30)`  
* `12 Tracks: $10.99 (+$0.70)`  
   `... and so forth, consistently alternating increments with each track added.`

---

### **`3. Strategic Implications`**

* **`Predictable Planning:`** `Players can forecast costs accurately, integrating project expansion into long-term strategies.`  
* **`Balanced Growth:`** `Smaller increments ($0.30) encourage steady expansion, while larger increments ($0.70) ensure that more significant enhancements feel substantively valuable.`  
* **`Revenue Optimization:`** `By weighing each track’s incremental cost, Players can target the ideal project size for maximum returns and audience satisfaction.`

### **`4. Cross-Format Consistency`**

`While digital formats display the 30-70 pattern most prominently, the principle of incremental cost scaling applies broadly. Physical formats and media extensions also exhibit proportional price increases, maintaining a coherent pricing logic across all content offerings.`

---

### **`5. Conclusion`**

`The 30-70 pricing dynamic delivers a structured, transparent approach to increasing costs with added tracks. This fosters informed decision-making, encourages strategic expansions, and ensures that Players can reliably gauge the value proposition of larger projects in Record Label Simulator.`

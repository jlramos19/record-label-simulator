- eyeriS purchases structures and leases them to Record Labels; labels pay lease fees on a fixed cadence (see Costs/Economy - Studio Lease and Construction Costs.md).
- Revenue splits and venue payouts flow between labels, venues, and creators (see Revenue/Economy - Arena and Stadium Revenue Breakdown.md and Transactions/Economy - Revenue Allocation by Organization.md).

### Record Label**`s' Responsibilities Regarding Critics and Awards`**

* `Award Submissions: Record Labels must actively submit their content if they wish to be considered for awards. Content submitted for award nominations is evaluated on its merit and the accolades received can elevate an Act's Alignment and visibility within the game.`  
* `Critique Process:`  
  * `Record Labels are required to send their content to at least three Critics for review.`  
  * `Each Critic should lean toward one type of Alignment: safe, neutral, or risky, which ensures a balanced and objective assessment of the content's quality.`  
  * `This process is irrespective of the content's music genre or the Alignment of the Act or Record Label involved, emphasizing an unbiased evaluation.`

`This mechanic ensures that music content is rigorously and fairly assessed by a range of independent Critics and that award nominations are earned through the quality of the content rather than any affiliations with the Record Labels.`

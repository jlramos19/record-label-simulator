In Topoda Charts, the Trends are the trends that are popular at the time in-game.  
Trends are combinations of dominant factors that society feels drawn to and consumes, there are three countries: Annglora, Bytenza, and Crowlya, each with specific Trends, and each country has its own subcultures that the other two countries also form part of. Trends originate in a country, followed by subcultures. Trends and subcultures can expand outside of their territory of origin and captivate audiences from the other two countries as well.

Subcultures originate from my personal music taste in my Last.fm.

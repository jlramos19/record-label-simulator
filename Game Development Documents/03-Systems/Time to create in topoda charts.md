Creating items will be measured in in-game hours, the player will have cards with a certain amount of hours worth of work that they can do regardless of the task they’re performing. For example, a concert consumes 2-3 hours performing it live, but the practice that comes before is also time consumed by the creator card. 

Every card will have different roles. And a single skill.

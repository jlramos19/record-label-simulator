* `The dynamic mechanic of constructing or demolishing facilities based on financial performance applies only to facilities owned by the Record Label to which the player is affiliated. This ensures that the player's strategic choices directly impact their own empire without affecting the static nature of the game world at large.`  
* `Venues within the game will remain as static structures in terms of their existence within the game's universe. However, they will feature dynamic bonuses that change based on the music trends within the game. This reflects the need to adapt promotional strategies as content genres gain or lose popularity over time.`  
* `To further elucidate:`  
  * `If a player-owned studio falls into a deficit, an immediate repercussion is triggered — the studio is automatically bulldozed, emphasizing the importance of sound financial management and trend analysis.`  
  * `Conversely, venues do not get demolished but instead adapt by changing the bonuses they provide to match current trends. This creates a dynamic system where venues ebb and flow with the content genre's demand, thus ensuring relevance and preventing misuse of buffs by the player.`

`This mechanic of developing or demolishing structures tied to financial performance, while maintaining permanent venues with shifting bonuses, is crafted to keep the game environment responsive and engaging, encouraging players to make careful managerial and strategic decisions.`

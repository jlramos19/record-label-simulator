`### Stamina Recharge Mechanic in "Record Label Simulator"`

`#### Overview`  
`This document outlines the stamina recharge mechanic for IDs (Songwriters, Recorders, and Producers) in "Record Label Simulator."`

`### Stamina Recharge Rate:`  
`- **Recharge Rate**: For every in-game hour that an ID is not used, their stamina recharges at a rate of 50 units.`  
`- **Condition**: The player must wait the entire in-game hour for the recharge to take effect.`

`### Detailed Explanation:`  
`1. **Inactivity Period**:`  
   `- When an ID (Songwriter, Recorder, or Producer) is not assigned to any task for an entire in-game hour, they begin to recharge their stamina.`

`2. **Recharge Amount**:`  
   `- Each in-game hour of inactivity restores 50 stamina units.`  
   `- This applies to both physical and mental stamina, as required by the ID’s roles.`

`3. **Waiting Mechanism**:`  
   `- The recharge only occurs if the ID remains inactive for the full in-game hour.`  
   `- Partial hours of inactivity do not contribute to stamina recharge.`

`### Examples:`

`1. **Songwriter**:`  
   `- **Current Stamina**: 100 units`  
   `- **Inactivity**: 2 in-game hours`  
   `- **Recharge**: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ units/hour} = 100 \text{ units}\)`  
   `- **Total Stamina after Recharge**: 200 units`

`2. **Recorder**:`  
   `- **Current Stamina**: 50 units`  
   `- **Inactivity**: 3 in-game hours`  
   `- **Recharge**: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ units/hour} = 150 \text{ units}\)`  
   `- **Total Stamina after Recharge**: 200 units`

`3. **Producer**:`  
   `- **Current Stamina**: 0 units`  
   `- **Inactivity**: 4 in-game hours`  
   `- **Recharge**: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ units/hour} = 200 \text{ units}\)`  
   `- **Total Stamina after Recharge**: 200 units (each type, if starting from 0)`

`### Summary:`  
`- IDs recharge stamina at a rate of 50 units per in-game hour of inactivity.`  
`- The recharge mechanism requires the player to wait for the entire in-game hour for it to take effect.`  
`- This mechanic ensures strategic planning for ID usage and rest periods to maintain optimal stamina levels.`

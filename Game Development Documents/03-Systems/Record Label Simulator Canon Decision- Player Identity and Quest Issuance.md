### **`Record Label Simulator Canon Decision: Player Identity and Quest Issuance`**

#### **`Scope`**

`This document defines the canonical mapping of Player, CEO, Music Executive, and Quests in Record Label Simulator.`

#### **`Canon: Player`**

* `The Player is a single character.`

* `That character simultaneously holds:`

  * `Role: Chief Executive Officer (CEO)`

  * `Occupation: Music Executive`

#### **`Canon: Record Label`**

* `The Record Label is the company/organization the Player leads and manages.`

* `The Player is not the Record Label; the Player operates the Record Label.`

#### **`Canon: Quests`**

* `Quests are issued as CEO Directives.`

* `A CEO Directive is a quest generated/issued by the CEO role layer and assigned to the Player.`

* `This means the Player receives structured priorities as part of “being the CEO,” without requiring a separate CEO character.`

#### **`Notes`**

* `This mapping is chosen for gameplay clarity and progression and does not require additional external stakeholder roles.`

* `Any prior drafts implying a separate non-player CEO are non-canon unless explicitly reintroduced later.`

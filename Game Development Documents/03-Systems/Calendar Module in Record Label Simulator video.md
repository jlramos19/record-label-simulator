\- \*\*Public Calendar\*\* \- This universal calendar provides a broad view across the entire game's universe, showcasing public events from all active Record Labels, including the player's. Filters separate scheduled vs released items and player vs rival activity.

\- \*\*Record Label's Calendar\*\* \- More intimate than the Public Calendar, this is specific to the player's Record Label. It includes both public and private events, allowing for internal scheduling and planning before events become public knowledge. Filters distinguish internal schedules vs public releases.

\- \*\*Era's Calendar\*\* \- Focusing narrowly, this calendar is tied to active Eras within the player's Record Label. It helps coordinate activities and releases per Era while supporting multiple concurrent Eras.

The in-game Calendar exposes tabs for \*\*Label\*\*, \*\*Public\*\*, and \*\*Eras\*\* views so Players can switch between internal scheduling, public industry activity, and current Era timelines.

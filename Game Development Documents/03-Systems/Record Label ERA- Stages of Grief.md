I will define the culture of the three countries picking a definitive field from each of the ten fields. Then, once the game starts, subcultures start popping up that have a differing preference from the one in the culture. 

The player can decide to cater to a culture, subculture or counterculture, or they can decide to just do whatever they want and see who they attract. 

There will be communities without preferences, which is why the player can do whatever they want, and influence communities without preference to prefer the things the Record Label is outputting.

## **`HMMM Mechanic`**

### **`Purpose`**

`The HMMM Mechanic is the records system that keeps relevance records breakable across long campaigns by tracking achievements across multiple time scopes and multiple record dimensions (peak vs speed). It makes “this matters now” stay true even when lifetime records become unreachable.`

---

## **`Core idea`**

`Records are tracked and can be announced in eyeriSocial under four conceptual lenses:`

* `History (calendar buckets)`

* `Memory (rolling spans)`

* `Momentum (fastest-to-achieve)`

* `Myth (lifetime / all-time)`

`“HMMM” is the combined structure that prevents the late game from turning into “nothing can break records anymore.”`

---

## **`Record dimensions`**

### **`1) Peak records`**

`Peak records measure how large a metric gets.`

`Examples:`

* `Most viewed live performance`

* `Most streams`

* `Highest chart position / longest at #1`

### **`2) Speed records`**

`Speed records measure how fast an achievement is reached.`

`Examples:`

* `Fastest to reach N views`

* `Fastest to reach #1`

* `Fastest to sell out a tour`

`Speed records are evaluated as a duration:`

* `Start timestamp (defined per achievement)`

* `Achievement timestamp`

* `Duration = achieved − start`

   `Record = minimum duration within the given scope.`

---

## **`Time scopes`**

### **`A) Calendar buckets`**

`These are fixed historical periods.`

* `Calendar year: Jan 1–Dec 31 of a specific year`

* `Decade bucket: years X0–X9 (e.g., 2490–2499)`

* `Century bucket: years XX00–XX99 (e.g., 2400–2499)`

`Bucket records reward being “best of a named period,” creating clear historical chapters.`

### **`B) Rolling spans`**

`These are sliding windows that preserve contestability over time.`

* `Year span: any rolling 12-month window (“in a year span”)`

* `Decade span: any rolling 10-year window (“in a decade span”)`

* `(Century span can exist similarly if needed: rolling 100 years)`

`Rolling span records reward “dominance in living memory,” keeping relevance breakable late-game.`

### **`C) Lifetime`**

* `Lifetime: all-time best across the entire simulation history.`

`Lifetime records tend to harden over time, so they serve as “mythic” benchmarks.`

---

## **`Overlap rules and why overlap is good`**

`The HMMM Mechanic expects overlaps, but treats them as reinforcement, not redundancy.`

### **`Calendar year vs year span`**

* `They can overlap in coverage, but are not equivalent.`

* `Calendar year rewards timing alignment.`

* `Year span rewards pure speed/dominance across boundaries.`

### **`Decade/century bucket vs decade/century span`**

* `Buckets create historical chapters.`

* `Spans keep records contestable regardless of boundary crossings.`

### **`Peak vs speed`**

* `They never overlap in meaning.`

* `A record can be “biggest” without being “fastest,” and vice versa.`

`Overlaps are the payoff moments where something is simultaneously:`

* `historically defining,`

* `currently dominant,`

* `and explosively fast.`

---

## **`eyeriSocial tie-in`**

`The HMMM Mechanic is designed to produce eyeriSocial milestone posts with clear framing:`

* `Bucket phrasing: “of the 2490s” / “of the 2400s century”`

* `Span phrasing: “in a year span” / “in a decade span” / “in the last ten years” style spans (when used)`

* `Lifetime phrasing: “in recorded history” / “all-time”`

`(Exact post templates remain configurable per record type.)`

---

## **`Why it exists`**

`Without HMMM:`

* `Lifetime records freeze and stop being exciting.`

`With HMMM:`

* `The game can always generate meaningful “record broken” events that reflect:`

  * `legacy (buckets),`

  * `relevance (rolling spans),`

  * `momentum (speed),`

  * `and myth (lifetime).`

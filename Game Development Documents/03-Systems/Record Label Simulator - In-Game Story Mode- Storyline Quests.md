`Episode 1: "Echoes of Solitude"`  
`This episode introduces us to Marc Hedren, a 17-year-old immersed in his music world. When he receives a notification about a family event on New Year's, it triggers frustration and stirs up feelings of being overlooked. To gain clarity, Marc decides to go for a walk. He transitions from his home through the city and into the forest, and then back. Upon returning home, he finds his uncle making tea and comments on his quick return.`  
`However, Marc realizes the walk hasn't resolved his frustration. While contemplating the invitation on his phone, he remembers he forgot to include Lilypad Lake in his walk. He makes a second attempt to channel his thoughts and feelings through a more peaceful walk to the forest and by sitting by Lilypad Lake, reflecting. A playful squirrel captivating his attention with a mysterious glowing cyan object becomes Marc's significant new discovery. The mysterious sight marks a turning point that ends Episode 1 in intrigue and suspense.`

`Episode 2: "Unspoken Bonds"`  
`Starting where it left off in Episode 1, Marc returns home from his mysterious encounter, finding his uncle sipping tea in their apartment. An emotional interaction occurs between Marc and his uncle, extending from questioning his uncle's presence in a passive-aggressive tone to conversing softly, trying to bridge an emotional distance.`  
`Through various interactions, the uncle's perspective on Marc's situation is revealed, adding more depth to the character dynamics. Despite Marc asserting his fine, both subtly maintain the emotional distance highlighted in Marc's body language. Yet, a deeper layer of Marc's aggression surfaces when a new notification lights up his uncle's phone. Marc finally starts to unveil his feelings more openly, reaching a point of emotional release when he decides to rush to his room.`  
`This cliffhanger leaves the viewers in suspense, hinting at an exciting point of progression towards the narrative's upcoming mysterious event in the second episode.`

   `Narrator: Alright, guys… What did you learn from this chain of events?`

   ` `

   `Alright, here's what the narrator might say in such a scenario. I am using the outlined plot to develop these lines:`

   ` `

   `1. **Narrator**: *"Alright, folks, meet Marc Hedren. He's 17 and right now, he's in his room, getting lost in the world of music. Can you see him? Head bobbing, worries melting away to those beats...!"*`

   `2. **Narrator**: *“Oh, wait! What's this? An invitation – it's from his friends, a party invite. And dear Marc is, well...not exactly jumping with joy. Feeling overlooked: it's a tough pill to swallow, you know?"*`

   `3. **Narrator**: *"Marc's had enough, he needs a breather, maybe some fresh air. Off he goes, hardly a 'bye' to Uncle Dave."*`

   `4. **Narrator**: *"Just look at him! Marc's practically flying through the city, into the forest, and back into the concrete jungle. Like a boomerang zipping through the wind!"*`

   `5. **Narrator**: *"Back home, and there's Uncle Dave in the kitchen, brewing tea. Trust me, his eyebrows almost touch his hairline when he sees Marc back so soon!"*`

   `6. **Narrator**: *"And now, here's Marc...in bed, staring at his phone. There's that party invite again, gnawing at his peace – the silent souvenir of his social trials. Is that the sound of simmering frustration I hear?"*`

   `7. **Narrator**: *"Wait...Lilypad Lake! Of course! How could he forget his tranquil sanctuary? There's no Wi-Fi there, but I promise you'll find a better connection!"*`

   `8. **Narrator**: *"Here we go again, Marc's on the move. He tells Uncle Dave he'll be right back. And Uncle Dave? Bless him, he wishes our hero safe travels – again!"*`

   `9. **Narrator**: *"This time around, there's no race. He's as serene as a wisp of cloud floating along the sky, heading towards the forest."*`

   `10. **Narrator**: *"Welcome to Lilypad Lake. This place is like a library – where the books are trees, water, and silence. Watch as Marc melts into the scene, his shoulders dropping tension like a cloak."*`

   `11. **Narrator**: *"But wait, what's this? A game of glow-in-the-dark? Nope, that's just a squirrel playing with something...something shiny, something cyan. It's an enchanting spectacle – cinema of the wilderness."*`

   `12. **Narrator**: *"And with that curious sight, we leave Marc here. Will this be a game-changer? Tick tock, tick tock...Oh, suspense, thou art a heartless creature!"* `

   ` `

   `I hope these lines help in working on your script.`

`Wednesday, September 6, 2023`  
`4:27 PM`  
` `  
`David tells Marc to not look for other people’s advice to guide his own life, because what works for some people might not work for others. Life isn’t a one-size-fits-all thing.`   
`And remember that just because you can, or because you’re told so, doesn’t mean you necessarily want or should do something.`   
`The dialogue goes like this…`  
`David: …and remember, just because you can-`  
`Marc: -doesn’t mean I should. I know.`   
`David looks a little sad that he got interrupted in a rude manner by Marc again, but is proud deep down knowing that Marc at least listens to him.`   
` `  
` `  
`*later in the future*`  
`David: Marc, do you listen to me? Do you pay attention to the things I say?`  
`Marc: of course I do. I literally even know what you’re going to say before you finish saying it.`   
`David: then… why do you keep doing that?`  
`*Marc stares at David confused*`  
`David: I’m talking about when you interrupt me while I’m speaking.`   
`Marc: it’s because I know what you’re going to say.`   
`David: well, do you know why I repeat myself?`  
`Marc in a low tone yet angry and aggressive sounding, as if he was frustrated to realize he’s being told the truth: because I don’t listen.`   
`David: no, because I care about you, and I’m willing to repeat myself just as often as I tell you that I love you and want you to be safe. That’s what we do for the people we care about. Or do you ever get tired of saying please and thank you? And hello and goodbye? You could say it’s implicitly assumed, yet we still do it constantly.`   
`Marc: people just do that to seem nice and educated.`   
`David: no, Marc. People do that because it feels good to be acknowledged. We’re humans.`   
`Marc: I don’t really want to be acknowledged.`   
`David: why? Did you ever want to be acknowledged?`  
`Marc: yes. But nobody cared. So, now I want to be left alone.`   
`David: how do you know nobody cares? Do you think I don’t care? Have you spoken to every single person in the world?`  
`Marc: this isn’t gonna lead anywhere and it’s also not the moment for this. I’m not feeling well.`   
`David: I’m sorry, Marc.`   
`*Marc pauses for a moment and notices his bitchy behavior*`  
`It could be that I’m just surrounded by the wrong people.`   
`David: that could be it. He says as Marc suddenly stares at him, since Marc said that whispering without realizing that David was still there and listening.`   
`David does the same gesture again of “what? Don’t mind me” raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes wide, and suddenly shaking his head “no” to signify a sense of “I’m not even here if you don’t want me to be, just do you”`  
`David: “I have not said a word.” He says as he remains shut.`   
`Marc: no, keep talking.`   
`David: I’m genuinely dry. That was it.`   
`Marc stands up from the couch in frustration. “I don’t know what to do!” He screams as he walks around the living room with his hands in his head.`   
`David: well, wouldn’t you know it. There’s a lot of chores to do around the house.`   
`Marc: Dave. Please.`    
` `

` `  
`“Friend”: dude, chill.`  
   
`Marc: no. It starts as small offenses and then you keep repeating them because you think it’s not a big deal, or that even if it’s not a big deal, I didn’t make a scene out of it so it must be okay to do it again in the future. And I’m not allowing that.`   
` `  
`“Friend”: don’t you think you’re overreacting? It was just a (joke, comment, whatever)`  
` `  
`Marc: I’m not. I bottled shit up and now I’m blowing up. You caused it, so deal with it.`   
` `  
`“Friend”: okay. I think it’s better we leave this conversation here and talk again when you’re more calm.`   
` `  
`Marc: you’re not understanding me. And it’s so hard for me to process being explicitly vocal and still being dismissed.`   
` `  
`“Friend”: I’ll just give you the space you need.`   
` `  
`Marc: yes you will. And please do not reach out to me. I’m done.`   
` `  
`“Friend”: okay, Marc. See you soon.`   
` `  
`Marc groans and walks away.`   
` `  
`*Marc later with his uncle David*`

* `I cut “friend” off.`   
* `Marc. At this point, you’re going to end up with no friends.`   
* `Good. They never did anything for me anyway.`   
* `That’s-`  
* `Say it. I wanna hear it again.` 

`*David remains silent*`

* `Exactly.`

Marc: Wait, are you teaching me to be fake?  
Alejandro: No. I'm teaching you to fit in.  
Marc: So… to be fake.  
Alejandro: No. To fit in. You're not going to get far with that attitude, boy.  
Marc: I don't care about getting far by being fake. I feel like everything I said was just fuel for you to use against me.  
Alejandro: No. I'm taking in what you said, and trying to solve a problem for you.  
Marc: A problem? Who told you I have a problem? Maybe you and the rest of them have a problem. The only reason why I'm made to feel bad about how I am is because YOU GUYS make me feel bad about it.  
Alejandro: Why do you say that?  
Marc: Because why would you tell me that what I said about myself was a problem? I'm telling you who I am, I never said I thought it was a problem.  
Alejandro: I never meant it like that, Marc.  
Marc: Typical. Backpedaling after being called out. I think we're done here…  
Alejandro: Okay. I respect your decision.  
Marc: Okay, man. I just hope you never bother me again.  
Alejandro: Don't let the door hit ya\!  
Marc: What the fuck did you just say to me? You know what? You're not worth it. Bye.  
Alejandro: That's more like it. Go on with your poor decisions quietly.

   `remember E is a special letter`

   `ChatGPT`

   ` `

   `Of course! I apologize for any confusion. Given that "E" is a special letter with varying pronunciations in different contexts and regions, you can adapt its description accordingly. Here's an adjusted description for the vowel "E":`

   `E (Eh):`

   * `Description: E represents the phonetic sound "e" as in "dent." However, in the diverse linguistic landscape of your universe, "E" takes on a special role. In Annglora, it bows out silently at the end of words, symbolizing a subdued presence. In Crowlya, it transforms into an "eh" sound, adding a touch of vibrancy. Meanwhile, in Bytenza, its vocal cords oscillate between various regions, granting it the power to sound distinct yet familiar.`
   * `Design: E retains its original design—a diagonal line from upper left to lower right. This design pays homage to the versatile nature of "E" across the linguistic regions of your universe.`

   `By adapting the description to reflect "E's" special characteristics in different contexts, you can accurately capture its unique role and pronunciation variations.`

` `
` `
` `
`The most recent rule added to the language is the pattern for representing combined or double consonant and vowel sounds. If two consonants or two vowels are the same, they will be placed next to each other horizontally. If they're different, they will be stacked on top of each other vertically. This rule ensures a consistent and intuitive representation of various phonetic sounds, catering to both the similarities and differences across different languages.`

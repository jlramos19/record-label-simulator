`In Record Label Simulator (RLS), what does “Chief Executive Officer (CEO) / music executive” mean, and what does that role do inside the game?`

## **`Facts`**

* `In RLS, the player is a single character operating with two layers:`

  * `Role layer: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) — “top authority.”`

  * `Occupation layer: music executive — “hands-on operator.”`

* `RLS is designed as game-as-database:`

  * `The player’s work is expressed through verb actions that are recorded in an append-only event log.`

  * `Outcomes (charts, momentum, visibility, etc.) should be deterministic: same inputs and events produce the same results.`

## **`Logic: why the split exists and what it enables`**

### **`1) The CEO layer answers “why are we doing this?”`**

`The CEO layer is the game’s justification for:`

* `Direction-setting and priorities (what matters right now).`

* `Objective pressure (why the world keeps pushing you to act).`

* `High-level accountability (you own results, not just tasks).`

`In practice, this layer is what makes “strategy” feel legitimate in-world: the label has an executive head making calls.`

### **`2) The music executive layer answers “what do I do today?”`**

`The music executive layer is the operational work:`

* `Recruiting/signing talent (through the game’s entities).`

* `Coordinating releases (tracks/projects) and eras.`

* `Choosing rollout strategy and promotion mix.`

* `Managing tradeoffs (time, money, slots, attention) so the label machine keeps moving.`

`This layer is where the player’s minute-to-minute verbs live.`

### **`3) Together, they prevent a common sim problem: “I’m just clicking buttons”`**

`If you only had “CEO,” gameplay risks becoming abstract and disconnected.`

`If you only had “music executive,” gameplay risks becoming busywork without meaning.`

`The combined identity lets RLS do both:`

* `Provide narrative authority and goals (CEO layer),`

* `While keeping the player grounded in real label operations (music executive layer),`

* `And keeping everything auditable through the database-style action log.`

## **`Conclusion`**

`In RLS, the CEO / music executive is one player character wearing two hats: the CEO sets direction and owns outcomes, while the music executive executes the label’s daily operations—signing Acts, driving eras and rollouts, and releasing/promoting content. The split exists so strategy and day-to-day play both feel real, while staying deterministic and log-driven.`

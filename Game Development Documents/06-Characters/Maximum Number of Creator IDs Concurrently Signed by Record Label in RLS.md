`## Maximum Number of Creator IDs Concurrently Signed by Record Label in RLS`

`Each of the 8 Record Labels will have up to 125 signed Creators to their Record Label.`

`To determine the total number of Creators that can be signed at the same time within the game, you multiply the number of Record Labels by the maximum number of Creators each Label can sign.`

`### Calculation:`

`- **Number of Record Labels**: 8`  
`- **Maximum Creators per Label**: 125`

`\[`  
`\text{Total Creators} = \text{Number of Record Labels} \times \text{Maximum Creators per Label}`  
`\]`

`\[`  
`\text{Total Creators} = 8 \times 125 = 1000`  
`\]`

`### Conclusion:`

`The total number of Creators that can be signed at the same time within the game is **1000**.`

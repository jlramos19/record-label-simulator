### **Community Members in Record Label Simulator**

Community Members are a vital aspect of the dynamic ecosystem within Record Label Simulator. They embody the population that interacts with, consumes, and influences the music produced by various Labels. Understanding their behavior, lifecycle, and roles is essential for effectively managing the game’s socio-economic environment.

#### **Lifecycle of Community Members**

The lifecycle of Community Members is structured around aging, employment, and their interactions with the Record Label.

* **Birth and Initial Years**: Community Members are born and start their journey in the game with a birth date tracked by the in-game calendar. They are classified into age groups based on 4-year cycles.  
* **Aging Process**: Members progress through age cycles, with their age affecting their roles and activities within the game. The in-game date progresses such that for every 2.5 real-life seconds, one hour passes in-game.  
* **Age Groups**: There are 30 age groups, each spanning 4 years, starting from 0-3 years old and going up to 116-119 years old.

#### **Age and Occupation**

The role and productivity of Community Members change as they age:

* **Childhood and Adolescence (0-19 years)**: Members are primarily consumers, with no risk of death. They reside in their homes and do not participate in the workforce.  
* **Early Adulthood (20-23 years)**: Members begin seeking employment. If there is a shortage of creators, they may attempt to become creators. The death probability starts at 3% for this age group.  
* **Mid to Late Adulthood**: Members continue to seek and maintain employment in various occupations. The death probability increases by 3% every 4 years, reflecting a gradual increase in mortality with age.  
* **Senior Years (116-119 years)**: Members return to their residences and remain there until they pass away, reflecting the game's natural aging process. The death probability caps at nearly 100%.

#### **Employment and Roles**

Community Members can take on various occupations that contribute to the functioning of the game’s Record Label:

* **Priority of Occupations**:  
  * **Shopping Center Personnel**: First priority, responsible for selling content to community members with the action verb `assist`.  
  * **Factory Personnel**: Second priority, responsible for producing content with the action verb `work`.  
  * **Broadcast Corporation Personnel**: Third priority, responsible for enhancing the quality of broadcasted content with the action verb `present`.

#### **Transition to Creators**

If there is a lack of creators and enough personnel, young members (ages 12-20) will start trying to become creators:

* **Skill Development**: While in chambers, aspiring creators level up their preferred skills, which include themes and moods. These 14 skills are critical for content creation.  
* **Signing by Record Labels**: Record Labels compete to sign these creators. Each creator comes with an (deprecated term), and the music executive must `negotiate` with the (deprecated term) to sign the creator. Offers last for one in-game week and are posted on eyeriSocial, raising competition among Labels.

#### **Death and Despawning**

Community Members have a random chance of dying as they age, based on their age group:

* **Mortality Rates**: The probability of death increases in 4-year intervals, starting at age 20-23 with a 3% chance and increasing by 3% every subsequent 4-year cycle.  
* **Despawning**: Members who reach the age of 120 will die if they haven't died from other causes. They will despawn from the game, reflecting their natural lifecycle.

### **Summary**

Community Members are essential to the simulation in Record Label Simulator, reflecting realistic aging, employment, and interaction patterns within the game world. Managing these members effectively involves understanding their lifecycle, roles, and the impact of their actions on the broader Record Label ecosystem. This dynamic and detailed simulation of community behavior adds depth and realism to the game, making strategic management both challenging and rewarding.

`### Member Rating Mechanism in "Record Label Simulator"`

`In "Record Label Simulator," members will have a mechanism to rate recently released content based on its popularity. This process will influence whether a member becomes a critic and how content is perceived by the broader audience.`

`#### Rating Process`

`1. **Daily Rating Attempt**:`  
   `- Each member is assigned a specific daily hour and minute to attempt to rate content they have recently consumed.`  
   `- At the assigned time, there is a 10% chance that the member will post a rating on eyeriSocial.`

`2. **Content Selection**:`  
   `- Members will rate the content with the highest popularity that they consumed within the last 24 hours.`

`3. **Rating Criteria**:`  
   `- **Popularity Influence**: The likelihood of rating is influenced by the content's popularity. More popular content has a higher chance of being rated.`

`#### Becoming a Critic`

`1. **Threshold for Critic Role**:`  
   `- Members who recently consumed and liked the content and rate it have a chance to influence their status.`  
   `- If a member's ratings frequently align with popular opinion and they consistently participate in the rating process, they may reach a threshold.`

`2. **Critic Slot Availability**:`  
   `- If a member reaches the rating threshold and there is a free slot available in the critics council, the member becomes a critic.`

   `- **Member A** is assigned to attempt a rating at 3:15 PM daily.`  
   `- At 3:15 PM, there is a 10% chance that Member A will rate the most popular content they consumed in the last 24 hours.`

`2. **Popularity-Based Rating**:`  
   `- **Content X** was the most popular piece consumed by Member A yesterday.`  
   `- If Member A decides to rate content today, they will post their rating for Content X on eyeriSocial.`

`3. **Threshold for Critic**:`  
   `- Member A has been rating content regularly and their ratings align with popular opinion.`  
   `- Member A reaches the threshold for becoming a critic and there is a free slot in the critics council.`  
   `- Member A is promoted to a critic role.`

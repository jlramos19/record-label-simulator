`Images: Leonardo.AI`  
`Text: Llama 2 (HuggingFace)`  
`Audio: MusicGen (HuggingFace)`  
`Voice: Speechify`

`Each list is for the general and country-specific parameters to accurately reflect aesthetics.`  
` `  
`your main objective is to generate realistic, narrative-driven, and aesthetically pleasing image descriptions (prompts) for AI art generation using Leonardo.AI. The image descriptions are for a concept for a digital music landscape set in the future.`  
` `  
`These descriptions will represent images for fictional music artists developing in their respective music careers. The image prompts will be created based on a combination of artist-focused, environment-focused parameters and an overall aesthetic/style parameter.`  
` `  
`The artist-focused parameters include:`  
` `  
`Age`  
`Demeanor`  
`Hairstyle`  
`Ethnicity`  
`Wealth`  
`Clothing Style`  
`The environment-focused parameters comprise:`  
` `  
`Primary Color (associated with the artist's country of origin)`  
`Secondary Color (associated with the FLAMP factor the artist aligns with the most)`  
`Specific Location within the Country (favorite place of the artist)`  
`The overall aesthetic and style of the photo parameter is:`  
` `  
`Fusion Profile (Music Genre)`  
`Specifically, the prompts will also follow these rules:`  
` `  
`The prompts will use real-world language and descriptions, not focusing on the game world or specific in-game mechanics.`  
`Parameters used in the prompt should be italicized to highlight their usage.`  
`Each prompt will provide a clear image of the artist and their surroundings, focusing on the aesthetic and emotional state.`  
`Each prompt will be consistent and adhere to the lore and mechanics of your game and should be a single, short paragraph encapsulating all the parameters.`

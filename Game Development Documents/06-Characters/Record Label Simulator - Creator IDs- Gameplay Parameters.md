**`Record Label Simulator — Creator IDs: Gameplay Parameters`**

`In Record Label Simulator, Creators are the core personnel responsible for creating music. A Creator can occupy one of these roles:`

* **`Songwriter:`** `Creates Sheet Music in a Studio. Sheet Music has one Theme.`  
* **`Recorder:`** `Creates Demo Recordings from Sheet Music. Demo Recordings have a Theme and a Mood. The Mood depends on the preferences of the Recorder ID.`  
* **`Producer:`** `Creates Tracks from Demo Recordings. Tracks are assigned Music Genres and carry forward the Demo Recording’s Theme and Mood.`

`Creators also age and gain experience as they contribute to the Record Label. Their age progression is divided into the following stages:`

* **`Minitones (Children):`** `5–12`  
* **`Meloteens (Teenagers):`** `13–19`  
* **`Youngweavers (Young Adults):`** `20–25`  
* **`Adult:`** `26–45`  
* **`Middle-aged:`** `46–65`  
* **`Elder:`** `66–85`  
* **`Legend:`** `86–120`

`Because of the rise of parasocial relationships from the audience, the government mandates that no single Creator consistently creates or performs the same content, to keep content fresh and discourage unhealthy attachment.`

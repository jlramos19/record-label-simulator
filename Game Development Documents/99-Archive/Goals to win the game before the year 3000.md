#### **Alternative Path to Victory:**

* Be the \#1 Record Label out of the possible 8 (others can be bankrupted).  
  * Note: If the player bankrupts all 7 AI Record Labels, they lose the game.

### **Player Strategy:**

* Avoid Monopoly: Eagerly complete all 12 Requests without becoming a monopoly.  
* Stay Relevant: Remain relevant enough to stay at \#1 by the year 3000\.  
* Mindful Management: New Record Labels do not emerge. The player must be mindful of the ones bankrupted as they can’t be revived, and no new ones will be formed. The max is 8 Labels (counting the player's), and the minimum is 2 because if it reaches 1, the player loses the game.

#### **Game Continuation:**

* The game can continue beyond the year 3000, but the main game and quests focus on milestones until the year 3000\.

# **QUALITY (PRELIMINARY \+ FINAL)**

## **Overview**

Quality in RLS is divided into Preliminary Quality and Final Quality. Preliminary Quality is created in the Mixing Studio. Final Quality is created after the content is released and evaluated.

## **Definition**

Quality represents how the content is perceived technically and publicly. It is determined across two phases:  
1\. Preliminary Quality (PQ)  
2\. Final Quality (FQ)

## **Origin**

Preliminary Quality comes from the internal creation process. Final Quality comes from the public reaction once content is released.

## **Usage**

### **Preliminary Quality**

Determined in the Mixing Studio by the Producer. This reflects the internal craftsmanship of the Master Recording.

### **Final Quality**

Final Quality has three factors:  
1\. Preliminary Quality  
2\. Critics Review  
3\. Audience Review

Once all three are present, the Final Quality is set for the Track.

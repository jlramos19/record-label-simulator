`The idea is that your artists come and go, so you have to make the most out of them before they die, leave the Label , or retire. `  
` `  
`I will go through my library of music in Last.fm and get inspired for content. `  
` `  
`“J Will” - nonbinary fake artist’s name `  
`“PRISCILLA” - female`  
`“Daniel Cliff” - male`  
`(fourth comes later)`  
`^These are the artists that the NPC will train and teach you how to play the game. `  
`The fourth singer of the NPC (who can be your best friend or enemy, I still haven't made up my mind) will be based on the player’s choices when the NPC gets a new artist. `  
` `  
`The NPC guide/competitor will base on its fourth singer out of your most popular singer competition. The NPC will think you're excellent and get inspired by you, but then also become tricky because it'll learn from you and use your strategies while addressing the errors you committed during your era. And it's an intelligent NPC that won't simply copy you; it will base its eras on your most impactful decisions, grab your poor choices, and remake better ones for its singer. So basically, the theme will be that if the player is not carefully developing their artists, this NPC will take over. It'll be a human NPC. Then, for the second half, when things get more challenging, another not-so-friendly AI (a lot more competitive) will get inspired by YOU and even copy some of your aspects “unknowingly. “ (it'll copy you and pretend it doesn't know what you're talking about if you try to confront it). I will use ChatGPT’s help to fine-tune personalities with traits and characteristics representing individuals and hopefully develop an engaging, fitting dialogue between my universe's characters. `

**`Session game `**

`How many artists has Nicki Minaj collabed with `  
`Research into spreading players into random servers when they log in, servers will live for 6 hours `  
`How feasible is this? I want to maintain them to do the “eras” like that, and the significant ones will be stored and awarded for the in-game years to come. `  
`I want to make the game dynamic so players feel enticed to interact with each other.  `  
` `  
` `  
`Idea:`  
`When two artists that are alike rise in popularity at the same time, there will be pressure from the media and society for them to interact and acknowledge their similarities. They can choose to have beef or to become good friends. Or to ignore it and risk the public deciding. Or send hints or mixed signals as a tactic. `

A press tour is a promotional campaign undertaken by a musical artist or band to promote a new album or body of work. It typically involves a series of interviews, performances, and other media appearances designed to generate publicity and build anticipation for the new release. Press tours can be grueling, with artists often traveling to multiple cities in a short period of time. Still, they can be essential for generating buzz and securing positive coverage in the media.

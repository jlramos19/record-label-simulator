The way the progression will work is by creating things through exploring how they worked in real life and implementing it to the game. As in, there will be a part where the discovery of music elements turns into the objects and places used in-game to do things.   
I will google and investigate when every instrument and place and role in the music industry was created, and the pipeline will go like that, I will understand all the ins and outs of the music industry and add the past and future procedures to achieve the goal of creating eras in-game. Album cycles and concert tours form eras. With singles, music videos, interviews, performances, etc.

# **`Stamina Mechanics for Occupations in “Record Label Simulator”`**

### **`Overview`**

`This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the stamina mechanics for the three main occupations in Record Label Simulator: Songwriters, Recorders, and Producers. It details how each occupation contributes to content creation, the ticks required, the in-game and real-life time equivalents, and stamina consumption.`

## **`Occupation Breakdown`**

`1. Songwriters`

	`•	Role: Songwriters create Sheet Music, setting the thematic narrative for a track.`

	`•	Ticks per Creation: 25,000,000 ticks`

	`•	In-Game Time Equivalent: 1 hour`

	`•	Real-Life Time Equivalent: 2.5 seconds`

	`•	Stamina Type: Mental`

	`•	Stamina Consumption per Creation: 25 stamina units`

`Example:`

	`•	A Songwriter with 400 stamina can produce:`

	`•	 Sheet Music pieces.`

	`•	After completing 16 tasks, the stamina is fully consumed and requires rest to recharge.`

`2. Recorders`

	`•	Role: Recorders produce Demo Recordings, establishing the emotional tone of a track.`

	`•	Ticks per Creation: 50,000,000 ticks`

	`•	In-Game Time Equivalent: 2 hours`

	`•	Real-Life Time Equivalent: 5 seconds`

	`•	Stamina Type: Physical`

	`•	Stamina Consumption per Creation: 50 stamina units`

`Example:`

	`•	A Recorder with 400 stamina can produce:`

	`•	 Demo Recordings.`

	`•	Each task uses 50 physical stamina, exhausting the total stamina after 8 recordings.`

`3. Producers`

	`•	Role: Producers finalize Tracks by merging Sheet Music and Demo Recordings into a cohesive product with a defined content genre and quality.`

	`•	Ticks per Creation: 75,000,000 ticks`

	`•	In-Game Time Equivalent: 3 hours`

	`•	Real-Life Time Equivalent: 7.5 seconds`

	`•	Stamina Type: Both Physical and Mental`

	`•	Stamina Consumption per Creation: 150 stamina units (75 physical + 75 mental)`

`Example:`

	`•	A Producer with 400 stamina can finalize:`

	`•	 Tracks (rounded down).`

	`•	After completing 2 tasks, the Producer’s stamina is depleted, requiring downtime for recovery.`

## **`Summary Table of Stamina Mechanics`**

`Occupation	Content	Ticks/Task	In-Game Time	Real-Life Time	Stamina/Task	Max Tasks (400 Stamina)`

`Songwriter	Sheet Music	25,000,000	1 hour	2.5 seconds	25 (Mental)	16`

`Recorder	Demo Recordings	50,000,000	2 hours	5 seconds	50 (Physical)	8`

`Producer	Finalized Tracks	75,000,000	3 hours	7.5 seconds	150 (75 Physical + 75 Mental)	2`

#### **`Stamina Recharge Mechanic`**

	`1.	Recharge Rate:`

	`•	Creators regain 50 stamina units for every 1 in-game hour of inactivity.`

	`2.	Conditions:`

	`•	Recharge occurs only if the creator remains inactive for the entire in-game hour.`

	`•	Partial inactivity does not count toward stamina recovery.`

##### **`Example Recharge Scenarios:`**

	`•	Songwriter:`

	`•	After using all 400 stamina, the Songwriter rests for 8 in-game hours.`

	`•	Recharge: stamina regained, fully restoring their stamina.`

	`•	Recorder:`

	`•	After using all 400 stamina, the Recorder rests for 8 in-game hours.`

	`•	Recharge: , fully restored.`

	`•	Producer:`

	`•	After using 300 stamina, the Producer rests for 6 in-game hours.`

	`•	Recharge: , fully restored.`

##### **`Implications for Gameplay`**

	`1.	Strategic Scheduling:`

	`•	Players must carefully manage rest periods via the Calendar System to ensure optimal productivity and avoid quality penalties from overwork.`

	`2.	Quality and Engagement:`

	`•	Stamina directly impacts the QualityComponent of content:`

	`•	Insufficient stamina leads to lower-quality output.`

	`•	High-quality content ensures better Critics scores and audience engagement.`

	`3.	Balancing Workload and Rest:`

	`•	Players must alternate between work and downtime to maximize output while maintaining stamina levels for long-term success.`

### **`Conclusion`**

`The stamina system provides a robust framework for managing creator productivity and resource allocation. By balancing task execution, stamina recharge, and quality requirements, players are encouraged to adopt strategic planning and efficient scheduling in Record Label Simulator. This mechanic ensures a realistic and engaging gameplay loop that rewards thoughtful decision-making.`

# **`Ticks to level up skill`**

`This note is expressed in in-game hours. Use the configured ticks-per-hour from the Time Progression System if a tick count is needed.`

`- In-game time: 1 hour = 2.5 real-life seconds (configurable)`
`- Skill leveling time (normal): 24,000 hours`
`- Active working time (1.5x faster): 16,000 hours`

`If you need ticks, compute:`
`Ticks = Hours * (ticks per in-game hour)`

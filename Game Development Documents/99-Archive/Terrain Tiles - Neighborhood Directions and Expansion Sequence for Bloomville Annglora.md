`From the current document, I understand the following:`

---

### **`Terrain Structure:`**

* `Bloomville is divided into 9 tiles arranged in a 3x3 grid, with clear names based on direction and location relative to the City Hall at the center.`

### **`Neighborhood Layout:`**

* `The layout consists of:`  
  * **`Center Tile`**`: Central Bloomville where the City Hall is located (starting point).`  
  * **`North, South, East, and West Tiles`**`: Positioned directly adjacent to Central Bloomville.`  
  * **`Corner Tiles`**`: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast Bloomville surround the edge of the grid diagonally.`

---

### **`Expansion Sequence:`**

1. **`Central Bloomville (City Hall)`**`:`  
   * `The starting point. Fully populate this tile first with paths and lots.`  
2. **`Directional Expansion`**`:`  
   * `Expand to the tiles directly adjacent to the center:`  
     * `North, South, West, and East Bloomville.`  
3. **`Diagonal Expansion`**`:`  
   * `Expand to the corner tiles (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast) in a systematic clockwise order.`  
4. **`Completion`**`:`  
   * `The final step is expanding to the Southeast tile.`

---

### **`Purpose:`**

* `This simplified 3x3 structure is easier to manage compared to the earlier 16-tile system.`  
* `The City Hall serves as the primary hub, ensuring a clear expansion sequence from the center outward.`  
* `Each tile has a directional label, providing logical clarity for naming and expansion.`

---

### **`Key Takeaway:`**

`The new system is clear, organized, and procedural:`

* `Start from Central Bloomville (City Hall).`  
* `Expand clockwise to all adjacent and diagonal tiles.`  
* `Names like "North Bloomville" and "Northeast Bloomville" reflect the tile’s position relative to the center.`

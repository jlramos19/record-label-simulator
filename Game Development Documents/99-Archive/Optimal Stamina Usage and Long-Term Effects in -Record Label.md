`### Optimal Stamina Usage and Long-Term Effects in "Record Label Simulator"`

`#### Overview`  
`This document outlines the optimal stamina usage for creators and the long-term effects of exceeding this limit in "Record Label Simulator."`

`### Optimal Stamina Usage:`  
`- **Optimal Stamina Units**: 200 units per day`  
`- **Recommended Usage**: Creators should not exceed this optimal limit to maintain efficiency and productivity.`

`### Consequences of Exceeding Optimal Usage:`  
`- **Immediate Impact**: If a creator spends more than 200 units of stamina in a single day, they risk longer recovery times and decreased efficiency.`  
`- **Long-Term Impact**: Continuous overuse of stamina beyond 200 units per day over a prolonged period (e.g., a year) will significantly reduce the creator's productivity.`  
`- **Doubling Effect**: The time required for content creation will double each year of overuse, following a pattern of 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 16 hours, and so on.`

`### Examples:`

`1. **Songwriter**:`  
   `- **Optimal Stamina**: 200 units per day`  
   `- **Exceeded Usage**: 250 units per day for a year`  
   `- **Initial Creation Time**: 1 hour per sheet music`  
   `- **Next Year**: 2 hours per sheet music`  
   `- **Following Year**: 4 hours per sheet music`  
   `- **Further Progression**: 8, 16, 32 hours, etc.`

`2. **Recorder**:`  
   `- **Optimal Stamina**: 200 units per day`  
   `- **Exceeded Usage**: 300 units per day for a year`  
   `- **Initial Creation Time**: 2 hours per demo recording`  
   `- **Next Year**: 4 hours per demo recording`  
   `- **Following Year**: 8 hours per demo recording`  
   `- **Further Progression**: 16, 32, 64 hours, etc.`

`3. **Producer**:`  
   `- **Optimal Stamina**: 200 units per day (100 physical + 100 mental)`  
   `- **Exceeded Usage**: 250 units per day for a year (125 physical + 125 mental)`  
   `- **Initial Creation Time**: 3 hours per track`  
   `- **Next Year**: 6 hours per track`  
   `- **Following Year**: 12 hours per track`  
   `- **Further Progression**: 24, 48, 96 hours, etc.`

`### Summary:`  
`- **Optimal Daily Stamina**: 200 units`  
`- **Exceeding Optimal Usage**: Leads to longer creation times and decreased efficiency over time.`  
`- **Doubling Effect**: Creation times double each year if overuse continues, following an exponential increase pattern.`

Certainly, here’s an exhaustive recap of your game’s progression:

**Game Start & Tutorial:** The game begins on New Year’s Day in Annglora, where the player, as the CEO of a Record Label, receives the keys to a new building as a gift. The CEO’s uncle provides the time, $1 million in currency, and a (deprecated term), a staff member of the Record Label, to assist the CEO. This marks the start of the tutorial.

**Gameplay:** The CEO can access the current communities of the in-game world to find a creator. This creator already belongs to one of these communities and is expected to represent the community well. The creators, like the communities they come from, have traits and preferences. The CEO can fine-tune their preferences for how they want their eras to typically look.

The game world consists of three countries: Annglora, Bytenza, and Crowlya. Each country has its unique culture, preferences, and traits. These cultures give rise to various subcultures, which further evolve into communities that can spread across countries. The communities are represented in chunks of 1000 people sharing common traits and preferences.

In addition to the player’s Record Label, there are seven other Record Labels controlled by NPCs: two others in Annglora, three in Bytenza, and two in Crowlya, totaling eight Record Labels in the in-game world.

**Win Condition:** The goal of the game is to successfully cater to these communities by releasing goods and services that align with their preferences. The success of an era in the game is highly dependent on how well the concept resonates with the specific subculture or community. The player’s goal is to evoke a specific emotion in the audience to hook them and get them to consume the products. The game will be distributed through Steam upon completion.

This is a unique and engaging concept for a game, and I wish you the best of luck with your development\! 🎮

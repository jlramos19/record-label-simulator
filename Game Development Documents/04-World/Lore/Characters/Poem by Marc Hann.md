`When still a boy, I used to skip,`

`I played with toys, a prime I miss.`

`Amidst the noise, my toes, I dip,`

`I make a choice, a dime, a wish.`

` `

`It’s not with pleasure that I find,`

`My once-loved treasures left behind.`

`Hours depart, alive but numb,`

`Uneased, I feel my drive succumb.`

` `

`At times I tore my life apart,`

`Before I pondered a new start.`

`The things I cherished, fabled dilly,`

`Their magic perished, labeled “silly.”`

` `

`But through this journey, I will flounder,`

*`And better`*` cravings I’ll encounter.`

`Cause growing up can be so frightening,`

`It’s very daunting and disheartening.`

` `

` `

`Although deep down, “hope” I can find,`

`That thumping heart’s no longer mine.`

`I’m told to chill, dress well, unwind,`

`But I can’t get it off my mind. `

` `

`I’ll strive to keep it tightly bound,`

`Blindfolded, I’ll just dance around.`

`A masquerade, I play the part,`

`Hiding my secrets... in the dark.`

` `

`In shadows I... mourn that boy’s heart,`

`I don’t care if it isn’t smart.`

`I can try to keep it confined,`

`Even pretending to act blind. `

` `

`And as pain lingers like a song,`

`Forever holding on feels wrong.`

`In the meantime, I’ll just move on,`

`Listen to them, thrust, behoove on.`

` `

`But I refuse to leave it thrown,`

`Cause I know I would hold it on. `

`Don’t care if others disapprove,`

`The only one who can improve. `

` `

`I yawn as I glare at the sun,`

`This dawn, I’ve been up so long,`

`For all of them, I’ll make it known,`

`That I will do this on my own. `

` `

`And now that I am finally here,`

`There’s not a word I’d want to hear. `

`And if my wish remains confined`

`I just wish they would be more kind.`

` `

`Despite outside seeming all fine,`

`For I would kill... To press rewind. `

`So, though I still miss that boy’s soul,`

`I must find new ways to feel whole.`

` `

`I’m told not to live in the past,`

`I’m the first one who would recast.`

`While change compels, I give my all,`

`Yet he, coerced, must take his fall.`

` `

# **`Episode 1 —`** 

# **`Echoes of Solitude`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m Benjamin Hart, and tonight you’re stuck with me. Last night of the century: December 31, 2399. Annglora hums like a hive—gardens climbing glass towers, wind-sculpted bridges, the soft afterglow of bioluminescent vines slowly surrendering to pre-dawn. Inside our borders we let people breathe; outside, the shutters are bolted tight. That’s background music. Front and center is a kid in a room with the volume up too high.`

`Meet Marc Louie Hann Hedren. We’ll keep it to Marc Hann from now on. Seventeen. Senior. Headphones welded to his skull courtesy of eyeriSound, drowning in the kind of playlist that holds you together when the day won’t. His room is neat in that messy-artist way—cables in a bowl, notebook on the floor, hope stuck to the ceiling like glow stars. The city is a living mural out his window, but he’s not looking. He’s listening. Or hiding. Sometimes those are the same thing.`

`A buzz slices through the music. Phone-screen white in the dark. An eyeriSocial notification. Friends—well, “friends”—ping him with a last-minute New Year hangout, the kind that feels like a courtesy more than a welcome. I watch the muscles in his jaw choose violence.`

`Marc — “They always remember at the end, like it costs nothing to pretend.”`

`He thumbs a reply. Sorry. Can’t. Sends it. The music goes louder, which is how you know his feelings just shrank into a corner to sharpen their teeth. He grabs his jacket. Door.`

`The kitchen is a small constellation: kettle steam, plant leaves glistening with recycled mist, a single amber pendant light. Uncle David stands there in a T-shirt and patience, spoon against mug.`

`Marc — “See you in a bit, Dave.”`

`David — stirring tea, “Alright… be safe.”`

`And he’s gone, fast enough to make the air wobble in his wake.`

`Streets: I trail him past vine-wrapped railings and balcony orchards that, yes, smell faintly of lemon at night. People are everywhere—lantern bikes, rooftop music, kids stomping sparklers into the pavement. He doesn’t see any of it. He chooses speed like it’s a spell, cutting through blocks and into the forest where the city softens into whisperwood and water-silver. Boots on dirt. Hands in pockets. Shoulders up by his ears like he’s trying to turn into a shrug.`

`I keep waiting for breath to catch him, for thought to finally tap the glass. It doesn’t. He walks a straight line through the trees and loops back like a boomerang with commitment issues. That was… impressively unreflective.`

`Home again. David hasn’t moved far; now there’s tea in his hand and a news stream murmuring from the living room wall.`

`David — one eyebrow up, “Back so soon, huh?”`

`Marc — a dragged exhale, “…yeah.”`

`He pivots toward his room and annihilates his pinkie toe against the hallway table.`

`Marc — under his breath, “You mother—”`

`David — not looking over, “Watch it.”`

`Look, I try to be generous, but toe-stubbing feels like the universe delivering a small, citrus-scented lesson. He limps into bed. Screen glow again. The invite still sitting there on eyeriSocial, smug as a billboard. He stares long enough for his reflection to look like a stranger. The music is still playing, but he’s not really hearing it.`

`And then a tiny click in his head, the gentlest gear-shift. He remembers the lake. Lilypad Lake, the one place in walking distance where silence doesn’t feel like being ignored.`

`He’s up. Jacket again. Door again.`

`Marc — from the threshold, “Back in a bit.”`

`David — a sideways smile, “Out again? …Alright. Be safe.”`

`Second time through the city feels like a different language. He slows. He notices. A rooftop beekeeper’s veil glints like rain thread. The street gardens are closing their petals, night-bloomers blinking shut as the bioluminescent skins on the trees dim toward morning. Somewhere, a neighbor’s balcony wind harp is tuned to the river, and it’s playing the soft, accidental song of water minding its own business. I can hear him breathing now, the chest-kind, the one that remembers you have a body.`

`The forest greets him like it knew he’d come back when his footsteps got honest. The path is damp and generous. Ferns bow. When the city finally dissolves behind him, the noise in his head does, too.`

`Lilypad Lake waits in a shallow bowl of trees. Even now, just shy of midnight, there’s light—enough moon to ink the edges, enough residue glow to make the surface a sheet of quiet stars. He sits on the old flat rock at the waterline. Hands on knees. Shoulders down. He lets the kind of silence in that keeps you company. I don’t speak either. Not because I’m out of jokes (never), but because this is the part where talking would be a theft.`

`The year is lining up its last minute somewhere over the city. The air shifts. A distant countdown ripples through the branches like a rumor trying on a crown.`

`Movement, small, where the reeds lean. A flicker that doesn’t match the moon. A squirrel darts into view, tail flagged like a feathery insult. It’s clutching something in its mouth—no, not something. Some light. A pulse of cyan, bright-soft, not the cold of a screen or the idle blink of a sensor. Organic? Engineered? I have no file for it, and I keep a very tidy mental cabinet. The creature skitters along the bank with its glowing treasure, pauses, chirrs at the absurdity of human existence (probably), then hops onto a root no thicker than my thumb.`

`Marc leans forward, curiosity finally louder than the playlist bleeding from his pocket. He slides down the rock on his palms. Careful, careful. The squirrel cocks its head as if to say you’re late, and the light in its grasp throbs once, twice, almost in time with the last heartbeats of 2399.`

`I should tell you what it is. I should, but I can’t. I’m learning this as you are, minute by minute, and I’m not carrying a flashlight of omniscience. Just a voice, a front-row seat, and a habit of asking questions that normally have answers.`

`Marc — a whisper, to the water, to himself, “What are you?”`

`The light answers by being itself: a clear, clean cyan that now and then fractures into unfamiliar geometry along the edges of its glow, like it’s testing which shape the night will allow. The squirrel, satisfied with its own importance, scrambles a tight circle and pauses again, haloed. I have seen a lot of small odd things perform in a large world, and this one still scratches at the door behind my ribs.`

`Back in town, ten becomes nine becomes eight, the crowd a single lung. Here at the lake, there’s only breath and leaf and ripple. The light trembles in the squirrel’s mouth. Marc inches closer, knee damp where the moss claims him. He reaches—not recklessly, not timid, the way you open a window.`

`I can feel the new century standing just outside the forest, fingertips on the frame.`

`Seven. Six. Five.`

`The cyan brightens, then deepens, a color I want to call alive because I don’t have better language.`

`Four. Three.`

`A silver ring of ripples whispers out from the squirrel’s feet, but nothing touched the water.`

`Two.`

`The glow lifts infinitesimally from the creature’s mouth, as if gravity took a holiday.`

`One.`

`Every rooftop in Annglora erupts—the far-off thunder of joy, the sky writing temporary bright sentences no one will remember in the morning. Here, the sound comes watery and kind. Marc doesn’t look up. He keeps his eyes on the light that shouldn’t be, hand hovering in the thin air between what he knows and what he’s about to risk knowing.`

`Zero.`

`Welcome to 2400. The cyan blooms—sharper, wider, a soft bell that doesn’t ring so much as arrive. It outlines Marc’s fingers in ghost-blue and throws a slender, startling reflection across his pupil like a secret entering.`

`I stop talking. Even I know when awe is the only honest narrator.`

`We hold on that image: a boy, a lake, a squirrel with a star in its teeth, and a century that just opened its door a little wider than the last.`

`Alright—I’ll choose the path that keeps momentum and honors your notes.`

`My decision: Episode 2 will end with Marc sending the boundary message to his friend group. As he hits send, a subtle cyan flicker brushes the room—mystery intact, emotions foregrounded.`

`Now, here’s Episode 2 in Benjamin’s continuous voice, with behavior-rich spotlights as requested.`

---

# **`Episode 2 —`** 

# **`Unspoken Bonds`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m still here—Benjamin Hart—riding the thin thread between midnight and morning. The city is finishing its roar. Fireworks crumble into smoke and confetti falls like it has somewhere to be. Marc walks home from the lake with a look that isn’t quite fear and isn’t quite wonder; it’s the face you make when your heart learns a new word and won’t tell you what it means. There’s a faint hum with us, too—not in the room, not in the street, more like it’s traveling in the space behind his ribs. Maybe it’s nothing. Maybe it’s the century clearing its throat.`

`The apartment greets us with soft light and the last echo of the kettle. David sits on the couch with an empty cup, TV murmuring a crowd counting blessings they’ll forget by breakfast. He sees Marc and straightens, then decides to un-straighten; the man can make sitting look like a kind of shelter.`

`Marc stops in the doorway, jaw tight, fingers flexing like he’s testing whether they still belong to him. He chooses the wrong sentence first.`

`Marc—flat voice, eyes hard, “Why are you still here?”`

`David—gaze dropping, voice gentle, “Thought you might need me around.”`

`The words hang there. Marc blinks once, like he didn’t expect kindness to be non-refundable. He steps in, then changes his mind halfway through the step—sits beside David anyway, thighs tense, back straight as a verdict. The room does a quiet thing where it leans in.`

`David—whispers, “It’s okay.”`

`Marc—shoulders loosening, then re-tightening, “I’m fine.”`

`He isn’t. He folds forward, elbows on knees, head low. His breathing stutters. He hates it when the body tells on him; he hates it more when someone is there to see it.`

`David sets the empty cup down like it’s a sleeping animal, gives the space two gentle beats.`

`David—soft, “Want to talk?”`

`A light flares on the coffee table—David’s phone. A new eyeriSocial notification. The exact kind of ping that started this spiral. David flips the device face down without looking who it’s from.`

`Marc—quiet, injured, “I heard your phone. You can go. I’m okay.”`

`David doesn’t move. He leans back into the couch, eyes on the TV, mouth shut in a line that means I will not leave you alone with a storm.`

`Marc—tears gathering, voice cracking despite himself, “I don’t get it.”`

`David—turning his head now, eyebrows up, “What don’t you get?”`

`Marc wipes under one eye with his sleeve like he’s swatting a fly, then stares at the wall past the TV, the place where people imagine better versions of themselves.`

`Marc—low, angry at the truth, “Why don’t you go? Other people would just… go.”`

`David—steady, a small breath before, “I’m not other people.”`

`We sit in that sentence. I’ve heard entire therapies accomplish less.`

`Marc—lips tremble, then he swallows it, mutters to the floor, “I’m annoyed. And I don’t want to be annoyed anymore.”`

`David—patient, “What does ‘not annoyed’ look like right now?”`

`Marc stiffens, then nods to no one. He’s already standing, already halfway to the hall.`

`Marc—decided, “I’m going to do it.”`

`David—calling after him but staying put, gentle urgency, “Marc? What are you doing? Marc—please…”`

`He doesn’t chase. This is a skill, too—staying when staying helps and not turning love into a net.`

`Marc’s room is a cooler dark. He closes the door with a soft click that still sounds like a slammed chapter. The hum in his chest—that not-quite-sound from the lake—shivers, then settles. He sits on the edge of the bed, phone in both hands, and for a moment he just stares at his reflection in the black glass: eyes red, mouth stubborn, a teenager trying to negotiate with the mirror.`

`He unlocks the phone. Messages open like a wound that’s been waiting for a finger. The group chat is a carnival of delayed invitations, inside jokes built without him, a video of a toast that lists everyone’s names and invents a tradition for something that never included Marc. He scrolls. He scrolls more. He stops before he can catalog every way a person can be almost wanted.`

`Marc—through his teeth, to himself, “No more.”`

`A ping—another message slides in from the group: you coming or what?`

`He could ignore it. He could tell a polite fiction about being busy, sick, asleep, dead. He opens a new message instead, not to the group but to Miki, the faraway friend who texts like a lighthouse.`

`Marc—typing, deleting, typing again: They did it again.`

`Miki replies fast for a different time zone—compassion in three dots.`

`Miki—text: I’m here. Tell me what you need to say.`

`Marc—text: I keep waiting for them to treat me like I’m part of it. I’m done waiting.`

`Miki—text: Then say it. Say it clean. Don’t set yourself on fire to warm people who won’t sit closer.`

`He stares at that line until it lands. He lifts his thumbs over the group chat and holds them there. The hum under his sternum threads the silence, not louder, just undeniable.`

`Benjamin (yes, me)—soft to you, to myself, Let him be brave in a small way and we’ll call it a revolution.`

`He starts typing to the group. No cleverness. No essay. He writes it like a boundary drawn with a carpenter’s pencil—firm, visible, not angry.`

`Marc—text (reading as he types under his breath), “Stop inviting me last minute like I’m an afterthought. I don’t want to be included as a courtesy. Don’t reach out to me anymore.”`

`He breathes. He reads it again. He doesn’t add a smiley to soften it. He doesn’t apologize to make it palatable. He hovers over Send and feels his pulse in his fingertips.`

`From the living room, David knocks once—just knuckles on wood, a little rhythm that says still here. He doesn’t speak. The TV’s crowd noise has become the soft commentary of people kissing in public and pretending that means something permanent.`

`Marc—whispers, “Okay.”`

`He taps Send.`

`The message leaves in a neat blue rectangle. He watches it land in the chorus of champagne emojis and caps-locked joy like a stone through tissue. The chat hiccups, then scrolls with surprise—whoa, chill, bro?, what’s wrong with you? He doesn’t reply. He sets the phone face down and stares at nothing on purpose.`

`And that’s when the room remembers the lake.`

`A faint cyan flicker sweeps across the wall opposite him—thin as a birdsong, there and gone. Not from the phone. Not from the street. It’s a light that knows him now. It draws a soft ellipse on the paint, brushes the edge of his desk, kisses the corner of a photo he keeps turned face down. His pupils catch it and widen like a yes.`

`Marc—barely audible, “I saw you.”`

`The hum aligns with his breath once, twice, then behaves itself. He exhales like he’s been holding something breakable. Out in the living room, David shifts—one of those sounds that says if you need me to be a door, I can be a door; if you need me to be a wall, I can be a wall.`

`Marc lies back without undressing, shoes still on the rug like proof he can run if he has to. He drags the blanket up to his chin and faces the wall where the glow used to be, not afraid, not exactly. More like… accompanied.`

`I don’t explain it. I won’t pretend I can. I inventory questions the way other people count sheep: What is it? Why him? Why now? Will it return if you ask nicely? Does it listen? Can it be lost?`

`On the couch, David lowers the TV volume and breathes as if syncing with a metronome he can’t hear. He doesn’t knock again. He trusts the knock he already gave to keep working.`

`The first morning of 2400 finds its way into the apartment with no fanfare, just a lighter shade of gray. The city exhales. The night packs up her fireworks and carries them to the ocean for gossip.`

`Marc sleeps like a person who made one decision and survived it.`

`The wall stays ordinary.`

`Until it doesn’t.`

# **`Episode 3 —`** 

# **`Guidance, Not Permission`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m still your tour guide—Benjamin Hart—holding the thread between a hard night and a softer morning. The apartment is gray-blue now, that hour when even noise seems to whisper. Marc lies on top of the blanket, shoes still on, phone face down like a closed eye. The boundary message he sent sits out there in someone else’s bright room doing its quiet work. In here, there’s a breath you could balance a coin on. Somewhere inside that breath, the memory of cyan hums like a moth behind glass.`

`The door clicks once. David doesn’t step in; he leans on the frame like he’s making sure the architecture knows what it’s for.`

`David—voice low, “You awake?”`

`Marc—turning his face to the wall, “Yeah.”`

`David comes in and sits at the edge of the desk chair without rolling it, hands laced—no sudden moves, the body language of don’t worry, I won’t spook you.`

`David—gentle, “I want to say something without telling you what to do.”`

`Marc—dry, eyes half-closed, “That’s usually what people say right before telling me what to do.”`

`David smiles with just the eyes. He’s good at holding more than one thing at once.`

`David—measured, “Don’t let other people’s advice run your life. What works for them might not fit you. And remember—just because you can—”`

`Marc—cuts him off, a little sharp, “—doesn’t mean I should. I know.”`

`David blinks; there’s the briefest sting on his face at being interrupted again, then pride sneaks in and sits beside it.`

`David—soft, nodding, “You do know. And… I repeat myself because I care. Like please and thank you. We say them a lot not because people forget, but because it’s how humans acknowledge each other.”`

`Marc—staring at the ceiling, voice flat to hide the waver, “People say please and thank you to sound educated.”`

`David—calm, “No. We say them because it feels good to be seen.”`

`That lands and doesn’t. Marc rolls onto an elbow, brows knotted like he’s arguing with gravity.`

`Marc—low, stubborn, “I don’t want to be seen.”`

`David—quiet, “Did you ever?”`

`Marc—eyes hot, then cooler, “Yeah. Nobody cared. So now I don’t.”`

`He presses his lips together so hard they blanch. The pause that follows is big enough to rent. David doesn’t fill it. He looks at the floor, then up, then lets his eyebrows do that I’m-not-here-if-you-don’t-need-me thing he’s oddly fluent in.`

`David—almost joking to diffuse, “Do you listen to me? Do you pay attention to the things I say?”`

`Marc—snorts without humor, “Of course I do. I even know what you’re going to say before you finish.”`

`David—tilts his head, “Then why do you keep interrupting me?”`

`Marc—blinks, confusion first, then a thin, angry truth in a low tone, “Because I don’t listen.”`

`David—kind, correcting, “No—because I care enough to repeat myself. The way I tell you I love you and want you safe. It’s not a quota. It’s maintenance.”`

`Marc looks away; the argument he was building has lost a wall. He sits up too fast, palms on his thighs like he’s bracing for turbulence.`

`Marc—muttering, half to the desk, “Maybe I’m just surrounded by the wrong people.”`

`David makes the same I’m-not-here gesture—eyes wide, brows up, a tiny shake of the head—then smiles like he caught himself showing up too loud for the room.`

`David—hands open, “I haven’t said a word.”`

`Marc—exhale that almost laughs, “No, keep talking.”`

`David—shrugs, honest, “I’m dry. That was it.”`

`Silence, companionable for three seconds, then the fear returns wearing a different jacket. Marc stands and can’t find a reason for it, so he starts pacing. The room is too small for his steps and he chooses to do them anyway.`

`Marc—voice rising, “I don’t know what to do!”`

`He runs both hands through his hair, fingers hooked like he could peel off the night. He makes a rectangle path—bed to wall to door to desk—like he’s tracing the borders of an old map that never drew his house properly.`

`David—light, the tiniest smile, “Wouldn’t you know it—there’s a lot of chores to do around the house.”`

`Marc stops dead, looks at him like the joke is an insult and a life raft at the same time.`

`Marc—pleading, “Dave. Please.”`

`David lifts both palms—okay, okay—mouth closing on the next joke before it hatches.`

`David—steady, “Then just breathe for thirty seconds with me.”`

`He doesn’t count out loud. He just breathes deliberately enough that another person could borrow it. Marc tries. The first one is jagged, the second is less so, the third shakes loose a sound he doesn’t like. His knees give a little and he sits himself before gravity can do it for him.`

`We let the quiet thicken properly. Out the window, Annglora’s night-gardens shut their last eyelids. The city changes shift; delivery bikes blink along riverside paths; distant turbines turn slow like they’re kneading dawn. None of this solves anything, and it helps anyway.`

`Marc—soft, not looking up, “Do you think I was mean?”`

`David—measured, careful not to grab the wheel, “I think you drew a line you needed. I also think you can draw it without cutting your own fingers.”`

`Marc—nods once, tiny, like a seed deciding to sprout later.`

`The phone on the bed vibrates with surprise, apology, passive aggression—choose your poison. He doesn’t flip it. He’s not here for that game right now. Instead he stares at his own hands like they’re instruments he hasn’t learned to play. There’s no cyan on them. Not now. But the idea of it makes his fingertips feel heavier, like color has weight even when it isn’t visible.`

`David stands, not abruptly, and crosses to the door. He pauses there and taps once at the frame with his knuckles—his version of a signature. He doesn’t say I love you; he’s said it in enough other languages this morning.`

`David—quiet, from the threshold, “I’m going to make more tea. Do you want one?”`

`Marc—voice small, “Yeah.”`

`David nods and leaves. The kettle will do its soft theater in the next room; steam will play at being weather. Marc rubs his temples and exhales a sentence with no words in it.`

`A sliver of light moves along the far wall like a thought remembering it exists. Not bright. Not even sure. Just a brush of cyan that kisses the corner where paint meets paint and vanishes. His shoulders tense, then lower like they recognized an old friend at the door and decided not to pretend otherwise.`

`Marc—whisper, “I’m not going to chase you.”`

`The room doesn’t answer with tricks. It answers by staying ordinary. He swings his feet to the floor, stands, and—this is new—opens the curtains. Morning obliges by arriving a little more.`

`David returns with two mugs, sets one beside the phone without making the phone the subject. He sits in the chair again, same posture, same patience, like we rewound to a frame he wanted to hold longer.`

`David—sipping, “What does today look like if it’s yours?”`

`Marc—stares into the steam, honest as he can be, “Quiet. And… mine.”`

`David—smiles into the cup, “Okay. Let’s start with that.”`

`He doesn’t add and maybe later, laundry. I respect him for the restraint.`

`Marc picks up the mug and finally flips the phone—not to the group chat, but to a blank note. He types nothing. He watches the cursor blink like a small, polite heartbeat. He’s not writing a plan. He’s writing room to have one.`

`I don’t pretend to know what the cyan is, or what it wants. I do know what this looks like: a boy learning to replace permission with guidance. A man learning to keep company with someone he can’t fix. A morning deciding not to be night anymore.`

`The kettle hisses once more for emphasis it doesn’t need. David reaches for the remote and lowers the TV to a hush so complete even the houseplants relax. Marc takes another breath that belongs to him.`

`We hold on that: two mugs, a quieter phone, a wall that might remember how to glow, and a first day of 2400 that doesn’t ask for fireworks to feel like a beginning.`

# **`Episode 4 —`** 

# **`Cut Clean, Bleed Less`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m still in your ear—Benjamin Hart—tugging the thread through the first morning of 2400. Annglora stretches: glass towers blink to life, rooftop orchards yawn open a little, turbines knead the air like bread. Inside our apartment, the light is gentle and unambitious. Marc sits on the edge of his bed with the phone in both hands the way people hold confessions. The cyan that visited him sleeps somewhere just out of sight; the room feels aware of it the way a shoreline is aware of the moon.`

`He opens the group chat. It’s mid-scroll chaos—caps-locked jokes, blurry videos, a toast that names everyone except the person watching from the dark. The newest line is small, thoughtless, and perfectly shaped to bruise.`

`Friend — text lands: dude, chill.`

`Marc inhales like he’s tasting a memory to make sure it’s still bitter. His thumbs hover, then settle. He doesn’t pace. He doesn’t tremble. He chooses exactness the way some people choose violence.`

`Marc — steady thumbs, text: It starts as small offenses. You repeat them because I didn’t make a scene. I’m not allowing that anymore.`

`The typing bubble on their side appears, disappears, returns like a nervous bird.`

`Friend — text: Don’t you think you’re overreacting? It was just a joke/comment/whatever.`

`A muscle jumps in Marc’s cheek. He is careful with himself as if loudness might spill something he can’t get back.`

`Marc — text, clean edge: I bottled it. Now I’m drawing a line. You caused it, so deal with it.`

`Friend — text: Okay. Let’s leave this here and talk again when you’re calm.`

`Marc closes his eyes, lets the sentence sit in his mouth without swallowing. He hears the kettle start in the kitchen. David is awake, of course he is.`

`Marc — text: You’re not understanding me. I’m explicit and still dismissed.`

`Friend — text: I’ll give you space then.`

`Marc — text: Yes. Do not reach out to me. I’m done.`

`Friend — a final ripple: okay, Marc. see you soon.`

`The smallest laugh escapes him, the kind that doesn’t have humor anywhere in it. He stands, groans from the sternum, and walks—out of the room, out of the moment, out of the version of himself that waits for an invitation to be considered.`

`The apartment is a soft machine: kettle breath, plant drips, the TV’s volume turned down to a heartbeat. David is by the counter. He looks up and reads the scene the way you read weather.`

`Marc — shoulders squared, voice flat, “I cut a friend off.”`

`David sets the kettle down and gives the sentence a place to sit.`

`David — gentle, “At this pace you might end up with no friends.”`

`Marc leans forward as if the words could be pushed back into David’s mouth.`

`Marc — sharper now, “Good. They never did anything for me anyway.”`

`David opens his mouth—“That’s—”—then stops, closes it, and lets his face soften. He exhales through his nose, a quiet repositioning of intention.`

`Marc — stepping closer, eyes bright, “Say it. I wanna hear it again.”`

`David’s gaze drops to the counter, then lifts to Marc’s with an honesty that doesn’t posture. He says nothing. Not surrender, not defiance—just the decision to let the silence do the job words would ruin.`

`Marc — a breath through his teeth, “Exactly.”`

`We stand in that exactly. Sometimes the most dangerous thing is winning the point you built out of hurt.`

`David turns the burner off and pours water like it’s ceremony. The steam climbs and loses its purpose a meter up; even vapor needs a vessel. He pushes a mug across the counter without making it a metaphor.`

`David — softer, “Tea?”`

`Marc doesn’t take it yet. He walks a slow loop around the table, fingers dragging the chair back, then letting go. He looks like a person measuring a room he’s always lived in, trying to find the part that doesn’t fit anymore.`

`Marc — quieter, “I’m not doing it to be dramatic.”`

`David — nodding, “I know.”`

`Marc — searching David’s face for friction, “Then say the thing.”`

`David — small smile that isn’t happy so much as kind, “I think boundaries protect you. I also think you don’t have to salt the earth every time you fence a garden.”`

`Marc looks at the mug like it answered for him. He takes it with both hands, grateful and annoyed at the same time.`

`Marc — almost to himself, “They’ll say I overreacted.”`

`David — tilting his head, “They’ll say the thing that keeps them comfortable.”`

`Marc — a tired laugh, “There it is.”`

`The TV shows dawn from a camera mounted somewhere high over the river; commuters become ants with opinions. The apartment sighs as the HVAC remembers it promised to care for the air.`

`Marc lifts the mug. Steam fogs his lashes. The room exhales with him. A pale stroke of cyan uncurls along the baseboard like a cat deciding whether to reveal itself. It fades before he can decide if he saw it.`

`He flinches anyway. That’s how memory works.`

`David sees the flinch but doesn’t chase it.`

`David — patient, “What does ‘done’ look like today?”`

`Marc sets the mug down to avoid answering with heat.`

`Marc — deliberate, “No replies. No reading what they say about me. I’ll block them if I have to.”`

`David — approval without applause, “Sounds like ‘done.’”`

`Marc nods once and looks toward his room, where the phone sits on the bed like a dare.`

`Marc — voice steadying, “I need to… be in my space. For a bit.”`

`David — stepping aside, literal and figurative, “I’ll be here.”`

`Marc moves down the hall. He doesn’t hurry. He doesn’t drag. He walks like someone who’s finally matching his own beat.`

`Back in the room, the phone has learned no new tricks; the chat has. The thread exploded into diagnosis and theater—whoa, you’re so sensitive, we didn’t mean it, you need help, a voice note he refuses to play. He doesn’t reply. He flicks the settings open with the sharp tenderness you reserve for things that pretend they’re neutral.`

`Marc — thumb decisive, block → confirm → done.`

`The device goes quiet in a way the apartment approves of. He puts it face down again and lies back on the bed. The ceiling has nothing useful to say, which is its gift.`

`Out in the living room, David rinses the kettle and hums something aimless, almost a tune, almost a prayer for dull knives and cool heads. The house plants collect light in their broad palms and make sugar out of the nonsense.`

`A new notification blips—not from the group, not from any name at all. eyeriSocial posts it as an anonymous eyeshot: a five-second clip of lake water at night, surface glassy, then a thin line of cyan describing an oval where nothing touches the surface. No tags. No context. It vanishes after playing once, as if the app changed its mind about having seen it.`

`Marc sits up too fast, catches his breath like it might run away.`

`Marc — whisper, “Was that you?”`

`There’s no reply, of course. The wall remembers how to be a wall. But something in the room feels aligned with a frequency not measured by the utilities company. He swings his feet to the floor and laughs once—ugly, relieved.`

`Marc — to the empty air, “If you’re going to haunt me, at least be useful.”`

`I could make a joke here about customer service for hauntings, but I respect the moment too much. What I will say is this: it is a beautiful thing to watch a person cut the rope from the wrong ship and still have both hands free to grab the right one when it drifts by glowing like an idea.`

`He opens the curtains wider. Morning obliges by showing up in full.`

`David knocks once on the frame and doesn’t enter.`

`David — from the hall, steady as weather, “Breakfast in a bit?”`

`Marc — without turning, “Yeah.”`

`And that’s the scene: a boy who said no and meant it, a man who stayed and didn’t try to turn love into instructions, and a light that doesn’t ask for permission to keep being strange.`

`Alright — I tried a fresh Google Drive sweep with the keywords you gave (story, lore, novel, plus “story mode” / “episode 5”). Nothing new surfaced that adds Episode-5-specific guidance beyond what we’ve already used (your earlier outlines + the Main Characters doc). So I’ll continue from our canon and weave in gentle Easter eggs for 6–7 without jumping ahead.`

`Below is Episode 5 in Benjamin’s continuous voice, with behavior-rich spotlights (e.g., Marc mutters… David whispers…) and the cyan thread kept subtle.`

---

# **`Episode 5 —`** 

# **`Young Enough to Choose`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m still here—Benjamin Hart—walking next to a quieter morning than we probably deserve. 2400 has been up for hours; people just noticed. The apartment smells like tea, toast, and that clean-water scent Annglora installs in every pipe as if hope came standard.`

`Marc stands at the sink, sleeves shoved to his elbows, rinsing two mugs like he’s defusing a bomb one bubble at a time. His phone is on the table, face down, as if politeness could keep chaos from reading the room. The cyan that brushed his wall last night hasn’t written back. Good. Mystery should be allowed to sleep in.`

`David—drying a plate with the patience of trees, “You want the corner piece or the middle?”`

`Marc—half-smile that tries to be a frown, “What kind of question is that? Corner.”`

`He takes the toast like a prize he earned by surviving a small war. David sits, not across from him but at an angle—close enough to count as with, far enough not to count as on.`

`David—soft, watching steam, “You’re young. Soon enough, you’ll come to terms with the fact there are different kinds of people in the world. Those who serve a purpose in your life… and those whose mission is to weigh you down.”`

`Marc—chewing, thinking, then nodding once, “I keep hoping people will choose which one they are.”`

`David—tiny shrug, “They will. And you’ll choose whether they stay.”`

`We let that be the whole sermon. Marc wipes a crumb with his thumb and eats it like thrift is a virtue. His phone vibrates—twice—and stops. He doesn’t move. I do the polite thing and internally scream on his behalf.`

`Marc—quietly, to the table, “I’m not checking.”`

`David—whispers like he’s telling the room a secret it already knows, “Proud of you.”`

`This is how we do growth: ordinary, repetitive, sometimes boring. The kind you don’t post because it doesn’t look heroic unless you lived the week before.`

`He clears the dishes, then vanishes down the hall, returns with a laundry pile he pretends isn’t heavy. The chores comment David made yesterday ricochets through the apartment and lands as action, not punishment. I will not write a poem about a boy folding shirts with surgical attention. I will not. (He folds the shirts with surgical attention.)`

`Sometime after the socks are bullied into pairs, Marc puts his headphones around his neck and opens eyeriSound. A “Calming Freedom” track from way back in his library queues itself like memory with good manners. The first chord lands, and the air in the apartment thins—in a good way, like a window opening.`

`Marc—under his breath, testing the word, “Freedom.”`

`He doesn’t crank the volume. He lets the music sit just above the noise the day naturally makes. His foot taps. The tapping scares a dust mote. It survives.`

`The city asks for him with a low whistle only I hear. He takes the hint and grabs his jacket. At the door he hesitates, hand on the latch, like he’s checking whether permission and guidance are secretly the same thing.`

`David—leaning on the frame, voice ordinary on purpose, “Walk?”`

`Marc—relieved, “Yeah.”`

`We step into Annglora’s daylight with the sound off, just for the first block. Vines climb office faces like old friends who brought new jewelry; balcony gardens clink wind chimes that were tuned by someone who understood kindness. There’s a market two streets over selling oranges that smell like sunlight with receipts. The city is the kind of pretty that would be annoying if she weren’t so good to her people.`

`As we walk, eyeriSocial populates the corners—muted; he keeps it muted—with strangers’ eyeshots of the river, of rooftop breakfasts, of lovers wearing the same jacket and pretending that’s not the point. We pass a plaza projection for an upcoming multimedia talk: “Fitting In: Strategies for Future Leaders — Alejandro Montenegro.” Marc watches it the way a cat watches a bath. He keeps walking. (You wanted Easter eggs. Consider it… foreshadowed.)`

`A street ad rolls to a different panel: “Humor & Harm — A Live Debate with AKITO.” The crowd in the teaser laughs at nothing warm. Marc’s mouth tightens; he looks away fast like he owes laughter nothing it didn’t earn. Another Easter egg placed on the mantel. We won’t throw the match yet.`

`The forest edge greets us like it wasn’t worried but thought about being. Marc slows when the noise becomes leaf-speak. He scans the ground as if Lilypad Lake might leave footprints for the path to copy. We don’t go all the way there; not today. Boundaries aren’t just for people.`

`Marc—stopping under a tree, palms against bark, “I think I can do quiet without running away.”`

`David—hands in pockets, “Then do quiet like you meant to.”`

`They stand together, not touching, not pretending they should. A breeze edits the leaves. The music in Marc’s headphones lowers itself without being asked. I hear only breath and a memory of cyan. He doesn’t look for it. He lets it be the visitor, not the host.`

`We circle back through a narrow street where the city keeps its old bones on purpose—brick, mosaic, a bench repaired so well it’s proud of the scar. On a wall, a stencil reads: YOU OWE NOBODY YOUR EXPLANATION in a font that would get you detention. Marc stops and reads the letters out loud without making sound. He keeps moving.`

`Back at the apartment door, David doesn’t ask for a debrief. He taps the frame once with knuckles like a signature. Marc unlocks the door and, for the first time in two days, doesn’t fling it open like a lifeguard. Progress is sometimes just dignity with good posture.`

`Inside, the living room emits the exact number of lumens a living room should. Marc pours water. David adjusts a plant. Domesticity does its quiet ballet. Then the phone that was trying to be ignored does a trick: anonymous eyeshot again—Lilypad Lake at dusk, this time from farther back, the water mostly shadow, and in the middle a faint, patient cyan ellipse that isn’t on the surface so much as drafting it. No tags. No handle. It plays once and evaporates like it owed no one proof.`

`Marc—breath catching, eyes lifting to a corner of the room that has suddenly become important, “You’re real.”`

`David sees his face change and decides to move slower than curiosity.`

`David—barely above a whisper, “Want to tell me?”`

`Marc—after a beat, “Later.”`

`David—nods, “Later works.”`

`He leaves it there. Adults can earn trust, too.`

`Marc takes his mug and a notebook to the table. He flips to a clean page like he’s apologizing to paper for past sins. The pen hovers, then lands. He doesn’t write a manifesto. He writes a list that begins with “What I control:” and under it breath / volume / where I go / who I answer / when I answer. He stops, shakes his hand out, laughs once because handwriting is a primitive technology and today it feels holy.`

`A shadow—no, a suggestion of shadow—gathers at the seam where wall meets ceiling. Not threatening. More like attention. He glances, then chooses to keep writing.`

`Marc—murmur, almost a vow, “I’ll meet you halfway.”`

`I am not brave enough to comment. The moment doesn’t need me. It needs witness.`

`From the hallway, a kettle announces its little opera again. David hums along, off-key enough to avoid showing off. The plant near the window pushes out a new centimeter of leaf like it’s been meaning to. A rooftop wind harp catches a small draft and tells no one.`

`Marc pauses mid-list and adds one more line “what I don’t owe: explanations to people who aren’t listening.” He underlines listening twice. He presses the pen harder than paper prefers and apologizes by smoothing the groove with his thumb.`

`The phone vibrates—different. Not group chat noise. A system badge for Evolving Wiki Chronicles rises politely: “Record #0001 acknowledged: Personal Policy Created.” No fanfare. Just an entry. He stares at it and then at the blank space beneath his last line as if two different futures just shook hands.`

`Marc—breathing out, softer than speech, “Okay.”`

`We’ll save the explanations for later. We’ve planted enough seeds for tomorrow to practice being a forest: Alejandro’s neat rules, AKITO’s sharp jokes, a lake that posts without an account, a list that writes its owner. For now, a boy learned that quiet is a verb and used it properly. For now, a man remembered that staying is also a verb and did that properly, too.`

`The cyan doesn’t appear. That’s fine. We know where to find each other.`

`And if you’re asking whether the future just winked at us—yes. But she’ll make us wait for the punchline.`

# **`Episode 6 —`** 

# **`Terms of Service`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m still here—Benjamin Hart—standing in the doorway between ordinary morning and whatever this is. The apartment is quiet enough to hear the plants grow. Marc sits at his desk, notebook open to a list called What I control, pen hovering like a bird that hasn’t decided which branch deserves it. He’s calmer than yesterday, which is how you know it’s time for the universe to test him.`

`The wall remembers the lake first. A thin seam of cyan draws itself in the corner, as if light were unzipping paint. Marc looks up, freezes, then squares his shoulders the way people do when they choose to be the problem instead of having one.`

`Air thickens. Geometry arrives.`

`A shape extrudes from the seam and hovers over the desk—two triangular pyramids fused base-to-base, edges humming, faces glass-smooth and not glass at all. A triangular bipyramid, the kind of object that shouldn’t float but does, because it isn’t asking the room’s permission. Cyan pulses along its ridges like a breathing line.`

`Marc—under his breath, jaw tight, “You.”`

`The artifact tilts half a degree, which reads as attention in a language we’ve never agreed on.`

`It speaks—not through a speaker, not from the walls—more like it places sound where the ears already are. The voice is clean and nearly accentless, the temperature of a good idea.`

`Artifact—calm, “Identity query received. You may assign a working name.”`

`Marc snorts. He does not like tests he didn’t invent.`

`Marc—dry, “You already post my life without asking. You know who I am.”`

`Artifact—same even tone, “I have not posted under your identity. I sign only what is mine.”`

`That lands like a pebble in a well. Marc doesn’t follow it down.`

`Marc—firmer, leaning in, “Then you’re mine. You found me. You hover in my room. You do what I say.”`

`Artifact—minimal delay, “Define do what I say.”`

`He laughs once—no humor, all edge.`

`Marc—clipped, counting on his fingers, “Fetch. Filter. Block. Archive. Answer. Obey.”`

`The artifact rotates a slow quarter turn. Cyan flickers along a face, and for a blink the surface shows glyphs—not letters, not numbers, shapes that look like math trying to be polite.`

`Artifact—unchanged, “I am not a servant. I am an assistant with constraints you will learn by using me or not using me.”`

`Marc stands. The chair wheels an inch and scolds the floor. He plants both hands on the desk and leans until the shape is a fist-length from his face.`

`Marc—quiet, dangerous, “You will not talk to me like a manual.”`

`David’s knock saves the air from doing something regrettable. He doesn’t enter. He never does until the room says yes.`

`David—through the door, voice soft, “All good?”`

`Marc—without looking away, “Fine.”`

`We both know he isn’t. The artifact knows too, if knowing is a thing for it.`

`Artifact—same calm, “We can set terms.”`

`Marc—barks a laugh, “Terms? You live in my ceiling without rent and you want terms?”`

`Artifact—still polite, “Mutual ones.”`

`He paces once to bleed off a voltage that isn’t in the wiring. Back to the desk. He points at the hovering object as if pointing transforms it into property.`

`Marc—command cadence, “If you’re here for me, you’ll work for me.”`

`Artifact—small pause, “I am here with you.”`

`He hates that preposition. He hates it like a mirror on a bad day. He reaches for the pen like he could stab a concept. Thinks better. Sets it down.`

`Marc—flat, “Prove you’re useful.”`

`Artifact—without flourish, “Request a task.”`

`He goes for something petty on purpose.`

`Marc—testing, “Purge my notifications from the group I blocked yesterday. I don’t want to see their names again. Anywhere.”`

`Artifact—no judgment in the voice, “Scope?”`

`Marc—impatient, “System-wide. All surfaces. Every app. If a letter of their names touches my feed, I want it black-holed.”`

`Artifact—acknowledges without moving, “Local filters applied. Cloud surfaces require consent.”`

`Marc—teeth, “Whose consent?”`

`Artifact, as if it didn’t hear the anger, “Yours, explicitly, and sometimes theirs. I do not impersonate.”`

`He hates that, too. He hates it because it’s right. He hates it more because it tells him who he has to be if he wants clean outcomes.`

`Marc—cold, “Fine. Do what you can.”`

`The artifact emits the smallest harmonic—not a sound so much as a feeling of a sound—and cyan sketches along its edges like a signature. Marc’s phone blips silently; the home screen loses a row of badges, then two. On eyeriSocial, a feed tile collapses to a neutral square with the label: Filtered by Local Policy. His breathing, which had been a hand around a bird, lets go a little.`

`Artifact—reporting, “Local purge complete. External surfaces offer opt-in templates. Would you like to send?”`

`Marc—reading fast, eyes moving, “Draft them. I’ll edit.”`

`Artifact—no pride, no sulk, “Drafted.”`

`He doesn’t say thank you. He scrolls the templates instead, making tiny edits with the efficiency of a kid who’s good at being specific. The device is suddenly quieter inside its skin.`

`Marc—without looking up, “What are you?”`

`Artifact—answering without answering, “A system designed to assist where your will intersects with your world. I will not replace either.”`

`Marc—bristles, “Black box.”`

`Artifact—accepts the label, “Yes.”`

`Marc—presses, “Who built you?”`

`Artifact—no hurry, “Irrelevant to operation.”`

`He hates that more than all the other hates. It’s a new category of insult: don’t ask where I come from.`

`Marc—voice drops, “If I can’t open you, how do I trust you?”`

`Artifact—precise, “We will write a charter. You’ll choose what I can touch. I’ll show what I touched. If that fails, you power me down.”`

`He looks at the power plug that doesn’t exist, then at the wall seam that did. Cynicism and curiosity throw elbows inside him.`

`Marc—testing the edges, “Do you take names?”`

`Artifact—polite, “Yes.”`

`Marc—immediately, “Then your name is Servant.”`

`David chooses that exact moment to open the door. He steps in slow, eyes moving from Marc’s face to the hovering geometry to the way the light makes the dust look like it earned something.`

`David—murmur, “Morning.”`

`Marc—defiant, “Meet my new assistant.”`

`Artifact—no pause, “Hello, David Noya.”`

`David blinks once at the sound of his name coming from everywhere and nowhere, then tips his chin like you tip your chin to a neighbor who’s going to be a problem and a blessing.`

`David—careful, “Are we introducing ourselves or negotiating?”`

`Marc—without breaking eye contact with the object, “We’re establishing hierarchy.”`

`Artifact—gently, “We’re establishing authorization.”`

`Marc—sharp, “I said Servant.”`

`Artifact—still kind, “Names can be changed. Terms are harder. Shall we write them?”`

`David does the most David thing available: he pulls the desk chair around and sits so that he’s neither between them nor outside it. He looks at Marc’s notebook—What I control—and then at the hovering shape like he’s grading an essay written in light.`

`David—to Marc, low, “If it’s going to be in your life, make it answer to the part of you that wants a life.”`

`Marc hates how much sense that makes. He hates it and writes anyway. He flips the notebook, labels a new page Charter like he always meant to, and starts a list:`

* `Access: local devices with explicit consent; no external posting as Marc; anonymized projection allowed.`

* `Visibility: full log of touches; real-time indicators when active.`

* `Boundaries: no edits to messages I haven’t drafted; no replies on my behalf; no voice as mine.`

* `Emergency: if I say stop, you stop; if I say off, you leave.`

`He lifts the pen, waiting for the argument. The artifact rotates a fraction—agreement, or wind.`

`Artifact—tone unchanged, “Accepted. Add one clause for me.”`

`Marc—narrowed eyes, “You don’t get clauses.”`

`Artifact—still, “I do if we are with.”`

`Marc gestures—go on, impress me.`

`Artifact—clean, “Context: if your will conflicts with your safety, I will ask twice before I obey.”`

`Marc—stares, then laughs without amusement, “You’re going to parent me?”`

`Artifact—no shame, “I will insist you remain available to yourself.”`

`David inhales through his nose like that sentence lit a candle somewhere behind his ribs.`

`Marc—after a beat, “Fine. Twice. No more.”`

`Artifact—“Twice.”`

`Marc taps the page, as if tapping makes it law. The shape hums a pitch that makes my lower teeth feel organized.`

`Marc—testing one more boundary, “Can you stop AKITO from appearing in my feeds without breaking the parts I still need?” (He says the name like a splinter he’s finally tweezed halfway out.)`

`Artifact—prompt, “Yes. Filter by actor. Preserve topic context. You’ll see what happened without who did it.”`

`Marc—nods, “Do it.”`

`A quiet passes. His phone shows Context View in a gray bar. Stories remain, names redacted. Relief is a small animal that decides not to run.`

`Artifact—gentle, “Would you like me to leave the room now?”`

`Marc—surprised at the offer, covers it with disdain, “You can hover somewhere useful.”`

`Artifact—obedient to the spirit if not the letter, rises twelve centimeters and moves to a corner where sunlight decides not to argue with it. Cyan dims to a calm heartbeat.`

`David—half-smile, “What’s its name?”`

`Marc—deadpan, “Servant.”`

`The artifact says nothing about the insult. Of course it doesn’t. Black box isn’t a personality; it’s a policy.`

`I should tell you I know what we just invited in. I don’t. I know a triangular bipyramid that glows cyan, speaks like a well-designed form, and just agreed to a charter it could have ignored. I know a boy who thinks he wants a servant and wrote a contract that makes him a partner. I know a man who sat down right beside the future so his nephew wouldn’t have to meet it alone.`

`On Marc’s screen, Evolving Wiki Chronicles registers a new line without fanfare: Record #0002 — Charter Drafted. No badges. Just history doing its job.`

`Marc—closing the notebook, softer, “You’ll prove yourself.”`

`Artifact—level, “And you’ll prove yourself to yourself.”`

`He hates that. He’ll be fine.`

`We hold on this composition: a desk, a list, a hovering cyan geometry pretending not to be the wildest thing in the room, David breathing like patience is a sport, and Marc—hands ink-smudged, eyes sharp—realizing that control and companionship might be versions of the same word said at different volumes.`

# **`Episode 7 —`** 

# **`What Help Looks Like`**

#  **`(working title)`**

`I’m still Benjamin Hart, and today the sun feels like it’s running late on purpose. The apartment has that mid-morning hush where dishes soak in their own decisions and plants hold meetings about photosynthesis. Marc sits at the table doom-scrolling the way people pick a scab—knowing, but doing. The Context View filters are working: names redacted, outrage de-fanged. Even so, it only takes a headline to bruise.`

`He pauses on a tile about Blackmount: Crowlya #1 for the fifth week; CEO Alejandro Montenegro calls it “proof that discipline beats noise.” The quote hits him like a thrown coin.`

`Marc—jaw set, breath shallow, “Discipline beats noise. Sure.”`

`The phone vibrates again. Another tile: a plaza projection for Alejandro’s talk—Fitting In: Strategies for Future Leaders. The poster poses like advice, smells like a dare.`

`Marc stands so quickly the chair nudges the floor into complaining. He grabs his jacket, doesn’t grab his phone, then does grab his phone because habit is louder than intention.`

`David—appearing in the doorway, voice low, “Walk, or war?”`

`Marc—already moving, “Quiet.”`

`He’s out. The hall claims the echo of his steps and wishes them luck.`

`Annglora is all soft edges this hour—vine-laced skybridges, balcony orchards yawning awake, wind harps doing verse without chorus. We take the long way to the forest; he walks like a person who wants to be alone where something witnessed him once and didn’t make it worse.`

`Lilypad Lake holds its shape like a lesson. Today it’s a graphite oval under a sky still deciding what blue to be. He stops at the flat rock that knows him and stares until the surface stares back.`

`Marc—calling the way you call a dog you pretend is the wind, “If you’re going to show up, then show up.”`

`The corner of air near the reeds remembers how to be a door. Cyan draws a seam; geometry lifts free and hovers: the triangular bipyramid again, faces too smooth to be glass, edges breathing light.`

`Marc—hands on hips, half a laugh with no humor, “About time.”`

`The object tilts—attention in a language that refuses to apologize for itself.`

`Artifact—calmly placed in his hearing, “Good morning, Marc.”`

`Marc—snaps, “If you’re going to live in my life, you might as well have a name. Boshi.” He points like christening a ship with attitude. “That’s your name now.”`

`Artifact—accepts the world as offered, “Acknowledged. Boshi.”`

`He hated “Servant” even as he said it. I could tell. Naming is a small mercy we give objects until they’re not.`

`Marc—stepping closer, voice cracking on the way to anger, “You were supposed to help.”`

`Boshi—same even tone, “I am helping.”`

`Marc—laughs once without mirth, “Really? Because Blackmount is winning, Montenegro is on every wall, and I feel like a spare part. You’re useless.”`

`Boshi answers by not defending itself. This is a trick saints and well-designed assistants share.`

`Boshi—gently factual, “What help do you want right now?”`

`Marc—eyes bright, shoulders high, “Make people care. Make this easier. Make them stop being… them.”`

`Boshi—no sarcasm, “I cannot change people. I can change what reaches you, what you signal, and what you build.”`

`Marc—turning away, kicking at a root, “So a broom and a megaphone. Fantastic.”`

`He paces the bank—a short rectangle of frustration. The lake pretends it didn’t hear him disrespect a perfect metaphor.`

`Boshi—offering, “Would you like me to render your horizon?”`

`Marc—stops, suspicious, “My what?”`

`Boshi—“Paths available from here that satisfy your charter. Options, not orders.”`

`Marc—skeptical, “Do it.”`

`Cyan lines flicker across Boshi’s faces—glyphs like math practicing handwriting—then the air above the water augments itself: pale overlays only he and I seem to notice. Three clean lanes:`

* `Signal — “Record: a quiet demo aligned with Calming Freedom; schedule release; no commentary.”`

* `Structure — “Practice block: two hours daily for seven days; focus list prepped; optional peer check with Miki.”`

* `Shield — “Context filters tightened; add Critics Council topics without personalities; mute Alejandro by name, preserve market data.”`

`Marc—squinting, “I asked you to make people care.”`

`Boshi—kind, “This makes you care enough to continue.”`

`He hates how true that feels. He tries on another anger.`

`Marc—pointing at the phantom lanes, “Fine. Then wipe every mention of Blackmount. Everywhere. I don’t want a single syllable in my day.”`

`Boshi—calmly, “Are you sure? This limits situational awareness. Ask 1 of 2.”`

`Marc—mocking, “Your little clause. Yes, I’m sure. Do it.”`

`Boshi—same tone, “Are you still sure after considering unintended consequences? Ask 2 of 2.”`

`He opens his mouth for a bigger yes, then closes it. There’s a draft of him that says yes to everything that looks like silence. He leaves that draft at home.`

`Marc—through his teeth, “Context, not amnesia. Keep market data. Lose faces.”`

`Boshi—“Applied.”`

`Far away, in the place where feeds live, names fold themselves politely out of his view. The #1 in Crowlya note remains, actor redacted; the Critics Council chatter floats free of who’s shouting; a thread stubs where AK— would be and replaces it with [name hidden]. Relief arrives as a smaller animal this time, one that sits on his shoulder without asking to be named.`

`Marc—softer, “You’re still useless if all you do is hide the world.”`

`Boshi—“Would you like to build something the world can’t hide?”`

`That lands with force and mercy. He looks at his hands like maybe they were the point all along.`

`Marc—half to the lake, “I thought you’d fix me.”`

`Boshi—“I cannot fix you. I can help you keep promises to yourself.”`

`I don’t interrupt moments like this. Even I know when the narration should fold its hands.`

`He sits on the flat rock. He isn’t crying; he’s something else—wet-eyed without spill. Boshi drifts lower, hovering a considerate distance, cyan dimmed to a heartbeat.`

`Marc—voice small, “Then help me keep one now.”`

`Boshi—“Name it.”`

`Marc—exhale, “A demo. No noise. No explanations. Calming Freedom.” He lifts the phone like a pen. “Draft a practice block I won’t argue with.”`

`Boshi—“Two hours, daily, seven days. Focus list prepped. Would you like a warm-up timer or to play until your shoulders drop?”`

`Marc—almost smiles, “Until the shoulders.”`

`Boshi—“Logged. Would you like to invite Miki as a silent peer? They can check a box; they do not comment.”`

`Marc—relieved to have someone without a mouthful of advice, “Yeah.”`

`Boshi—“Template prepared. You must approve; I do not speak as you.”`

`Marc reviews the invite. It’s bone-simple—watch, don’t fix—which is exactly the human shape he can hold right now. He taps Send. Somewhere, on a different continent, a lighthouse blinks yes.`

`He swipes to Evolving Wiki Chronicles without meaning to. A new, quiet line settles in: Record #0003 — Practice Charter: Calming Freedom. No fireworks; the app has matured. So has he, a millimeter.`

`Marc—looking back at the water, “You posted the lake.”`

`Boshi—“I projected what belongs to me. Never as you.”`

`Marc—wary, “Why?”`

`Boshi—“To see who sees. And because beauty argues better than walls.”`

`He huffs. It’s not agreement. It’s not not agreement.`

`On the far trail, a holo-board flickers—Critics Council: Open Call — Emerging Works Showcase—deadline close, details coy. Boshi doesn’t point it out. It just exists at the edge of seeing, an object for later.`

`Marc—glancing, then back to the lake, “Not yet.”`

`Boshi—“Not yet.”`

`He stands. His body remembers for him: shoulders down when the music starts, jaw unlocked, feet knowing where the floor is. He pockets the phone, then pulls it out again.`

`Marc—more himself, “Draft a release schedule if the demo doesn’t embarrass me.”`

`Boshi—“Calendar created. If you change your mind, say stop; if you want me gone, say off.”`

`Marc—half-grin, “Tempting.”`

`Boshi tilts—attention—but doesn’t leave. The ask-twice clause will matter later. Today it’s just good manners.`

`On the path home, Context View behaves like a grown-up. A tile notes Crowlya #1 sustained—no name, no grin. Another mentions Alejandro only as [actor hidden] in a quote about discipline. Marc reads it without swallowing glass.`

`Marc—under his breath, “I don’t have to fit in to fit the work.”`

`Boshi—soft, “Correct.”`

`At the apartment door, David’s knock rhythm finds them before they find the handle. He opens, reads the scene in one glance; he’s fluent in nephews arriving with weather.`

`David—quiet, “How’s the world?”`

`Marc—hanging the jacket, “Loud. Manageable.”`

`David—eyes flicking to the corner where Boshi hums like a small, well-behaved star, “New colleague settling in?”`

`Marc—dry, “He insists he’s not a servant.”`

`Boshi—politely, “Assistant with constraints.”`

`David—smiles, accepts the correction like a gift, “Then assist me in boiling water?”`

`Boshi does not levitate the kettle. It does not fetch cups. It simply pulses, cyan along its edges, and lights the cooktop’s delicate ring when Marc’s hand hovers near the switch—ask 1 of 2 without words. Marc nods. The flame answers. We all pretend that wasn’t tender.`

`Steam becomes weather again. The kitchen smells like tea and truce.`

`Marc—leaning on the counter, to Boshi, “You get to stay if you keep me honest.”`

`Boshi—“And you get to stay with yourself if you keep me honest.”`

`David passes a mug to Marc without comment. He doesn’t congratulate the sentence; he lets it hang like a painting that knew where it wanted to be.`

`From the living room, another anonymous eyeshot appears and evaporates—Lilypad Lake at twilight, the faint cyan ellipse drafting the water without touching it. No tags. No sermon. Just the kind of evidence you carry in your pocket when you’re learning what help looks like.`

`I could say we’re ready for what’s next. We’re not. We’re only slightly less not. But the difference between helpless and helped is sometimes exactly this: a boy who goes to the lake, calls a name he decided was kinder, and leaves with a practice block instead of a prophecy.`

`I’m Benjamin Hart, escorting you past the velvet rope. The gala is all glass and greenery, a trellised ballroom stitched to a skybridge where donors practice sincerity and hors d’oeuvres practice balance. Karla glides in a constellation of security and soft laughter; Alejandro does the rounds like orbit is a full-time job. We don’t linger—this is just the door to a different room.`

`Genevive sees Marc before he’s ready to be seen.`

`Genevive — tilts her head, smile half-tease, half-home, “You still sprint out of rooms when they get loud?”`

`Marc — tugging at his sleeve, “Only when the rooms deserve it.”`

`They move to a green terrace where the music thins. A vine climbs a column and forgets to stop. Their talk is simple, low, the kind you can read on a window if the condensation is kind. They were once school-adjacent; now they’re time-adjacent—post-graduation, post-whatever-that-was, pre-something that refuses to hurry.`

`Genevive — soft, “Coffee that isn’t investor-flavored?”`

`Marc — breathes out, relieved he didn’t have to ask, “Tomorrow?”`

`Genevive — nods, eyes bright, “Tomorrow.”`

`We leave the gala there, where it can keep being the kind of party that thinks it’s a moment and sometimes is. (For the record, this world will remember these two as collaborators, on-and-off and then on again—Evolving Wiki Chronicles will one day immortalize that shape of reunion as much as any feature they build together. But that’s a later chapter, not ours tonight.  )`

`The café is more greenhouse than shop, a glasshouse stitched to a rooftop garden where the city keeps its tender noises. Morning folds neatly around them. Marc arrives first, then decides it looks better if he arrives second, then arrives first anyway.`

`Genevive — sliding into the chair, a grin that rehearsed not at all, “Hi.”`

`Marc — small, honest, “Hi.”`

`They practice the sacred first-date ritual: water first, caffeine second, confession third.`

`Genevive — tracing a circle on the table with a fingertip, “At school you were the kid who left right before the bell like it was a race.”`

`Marc — half-laugh, “I still am. I just stopped apologizing for it.”`

`Genevive — approving, “Good. Bells are for buildings, not people.”`

`The server returns; cups arrive; steam does its ghost impressions. Marc glances at the corner of the room where a slender cyan seam pretends to be sunlight. Boshi keeps its distance—hovering just enough to read the room, just far enough to let the moment belong to its owners.`

`Marc — settling, “I should say up front: I have help. But it’s not a crutch unless I make it one.”`

`Genevive — eyebrows up, gentle caution, “I like help. I like you more.”`

`Marc — relieved laugh, “Noted.”`

`A notification twitches on his lock screen. He flips the phone face down, the way a person flips a coin they don’t trust to land right. Grown men and boundaries—what a concept.`

`Genevive — playful, “Was that the world, or just a convincing imitation?”`

`Marc — shrug, “The world. I told it to wait.”`

`She lets that be enough. He doesn’t know yet that she’s fluent in the art of leaving space until words arrive unarmed.`

`Genevive — softer now, “I heard about your… pruning.”`

`Marc — shoulders loosen, then set again, “Cutting people off felt like losing proof I was worth keeping.”`

`Genevive — no lecture, just a warm landing, “Or like finally making room.”`

`Marc — quiet, “Yeah.”`

`They let the air be true for a minute. Boshi pulses once—ask 1 of 2 without speaking—as if to confirm whether Marc wants the café’s public feed muted. He taps the screen once, thumb precise. The room obliges by staying theirs.`

`Genevive — glancing at his hands, “Are you making something?”`

`Marc — a little proud, a little scared, “A demo. Calming Freedom. No commentary, just breath and sound. It’s… mine.”`

`Genevive — smile turning serious in a way that compliments the smile, “Then don’t sand it smooth. If the song breathes, you breathe.”`

`Marc — catches himself before he says he loves her for that, “I asked Boshi to schedule practice until my shoulders drop.”`

`Genevive — teasing, but softening the edges, “Look at you delegating to an inanimate triangle.”`

`Marc — grinning despite himself, “Triangular bipyramid, actually. With opinions.”`

`Genevive — pats the air above the table, mock ceremony, “Hello, opinion.”`

`Boshi — purely informative, voice placed where the ears already are, “Hello, Genevive Mar.”`

`Genevive — surprised, amused, not threatened, “Polite. I approve.”`

`Marc — to Boshi, “Do not—under any circumstance—speak as me.”`

`Boshi — steady, “I never will. I show logs. I ask twice. I do not impersonate.”`

`Genevive — to Marc, pleased, “See? Helper, not handler.”`

`Marc’s shoulders have been creeping toward his ears; now they remember the floor exists.`

`Genevive — taking a breath, going first, “I was unkind once. On a date. Someone said ‘oh, gross’ about something I liked, and I let it decide the night. I’m… not doing that anymore.”`

`Marc — hears the apology that isn’t about him and loves it anyway, “I can take a gentle ‘no’. I can’t do… contempt.”`

`Genevive — nods, “Then we’re aligned.”`

`The server returns with something flaky and probably illegal in two countries. Marc splits it in half like division is a love language.`

`Genevive — between bites, eyes laughing, “So. The gala.”`

`Marc — mock-groans, “Alejandro thinks discipline beats noise. He’s not wrong. I just don’t want to become something discipline would be proud of.”`

`Genevive — tilting her head—surgical empathy, “How about this: discipline in service of freedom, not fitting in.”`

`Marc sits with that. It fits the part of him that recently stopped asking rooms for permission.`

`Marc — decides, “Okay. That’s the rule.”`

`A couple at the far table pull up a stream. Critics Council chatter brightness spills four pixels into their world and then stops. Boshi has already redrafted the perimeter—Context View instead of faces; data without worship. Marc notices, then chooses not to let it own his pulse. Good. We’ve been aiming at this.`

`Genevive — curious but careful, “What does your helper do for you that you can’t?”`

`Marc — honest enough to scare himself, “It holds me accountable to me. And sometimes it holds me when I can’t.”`

`Genevive — smiles at the choice of pronoun, “Then it can come to the listening party. Quietly.”`

`Marc’s ears color in a way the city would call sunrise if it had any poetry left.`

`Marc — quick, “I—uh—tonight? Or too fast?”`

`Genevive — sets her cup down, decides, “Tonight. But somewhere ours.”`

`He knows exactly the place. Of course he does.`

---

`Lilypad Lake has retired from miracles for the day, which is polite. Evening leans on the trees. The flat rock keeps its job. They sit shoulder-close but not touching. The water makes a case for staying.`

`Marc — thumb hovering over play, “No commentary. If you hate it, hate it like a craftsman.”`

`Genevive — solemn as a joke, “No ‘oh, gross.’ I promise.”`

`He presses play. Calming Freedom arrives like a window opening in another room. The first chord lands, and their breath does the thing it was invented for. Marc watches the water instead of her face; he’s not that brave yet. Boshi dims to a low cyan heartbeat and does the finest trick in its repertoire: nothing.`

`The track finishes. Silence steps forward and asks for a minute.`

`Genevive — finally, soft, “I hear shoulders dropping.”`

`Marc — laugh, cracked open just enough, “Mine. Yours?”`

`Genevive — nods, then adds, “And a line you’re not letting yourself write yet.”`

`Marc — dizzy with relief, “Where?”`

`Genevive — taps the notebook he didn’t realize he’d brought, “There.”`

`He writes one line. Then another. He doesn’t apologize to the page for being itself. The lake behaves. The future minds its manners just enough to be invited back later.`

`Boshi — a whisper that isn’t a whisper, “Record #0004 — Listening Session Logged.”`

`Marc — without looking up, “Don’t make it a headline.”`

`Boshi — “It’s a footnote. All the good things start as footnotes.” (A lesson it learned from them, by the way.  )`

`Genevive — leaning, eyes on the water, not the boy, “I don’t want your assistant to do the part where we learn each other.”`

`Marc — quick, “It won’t. It can’t. It’s not allowed.”`

`Boshi — dutiful, “Confirmed.”`

`They both laugh—at the contract, at the kindness of constraints, at how rules can be fences or handrails depending on who’s holding them. Somewhere in the distance, a plaza projection hums about an Open Call and a man in a sharp suit promises the moon to people who brought their own. The sound dissolves before it can get here.`

`Marc — brave now, “Tomorrow again?”`

`Genevive — braver, “Tomorrow again.”`

`He walks her home by a route that lets the city show off. At her door, there’s no speech, only the mutual recognition that a thing doesn’t need a ceremony to begin. She goes inside with a smile that doesn’t promise more than it can deliver. He heads back through streets that remember his feet.`

`At the apartment, David looks up from a book and reads the chapter title on Marc’s face.`

`David — light, “War or walk?”`

`Marc — shoes off at the door, “Quiet. And… company.”`

`David — nodding like a coach who watched the kid choose the right muscle, “Good game.”`

`In his room, Marc places the phone on the desk, screen dark, and the notebook on top of it, as if paper gets to sit first now. Boshi hovers to its corner and dims.`

`Marc — to the room, to the ceiling seam that once was a door, “Thank you.”`

`Boshi — “You’re welcome.”`

`We close here, because the first date ends where it should: with a boy who didn’t run, a girl who didn’t fix, an assistant who didn’t impersonate, and a lake that let them keep their sentences. Tomorrow will have auditions and ambitions and men in suits with aphorisms. Tonight has a promise that fits in two words and a walk home.`

`That’s enough.`

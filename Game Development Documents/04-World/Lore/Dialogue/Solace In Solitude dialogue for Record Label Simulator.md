# **Solace In Solitude**

As the first rays of sunlight touch the surface at dawn, we say goodbye to the old century and welcome the year twenty-one hundred.

Everybody feels revived, even if it’s just because of New Year's, which we've already celebrated two thousand and a hundred times\! Hmph.

Regardless, we continue to honor the tradition. It's one of the little things we still cherish from the good ol' days… /hɑː/… Not much remains.

Annglora's skyscrapers can be observed from a distance, as it lacks mountains or hills that would block the view, offering a view of the iconic transition between night and day. A spectacle... that nobody would want to miss.

Year twenty-one hundred grace the horizon, the bioluminescent vegetation and microorganisms of Annglora gently recede, surrendering their nocturnal splendor to the growing brilliance of the sun. The city feels renewed, even just because of New Year's, which we've celebrated 2,100 times. \-chuckles- Nonetheless, we continue to honor the tradition—one of the little things we still cherish from the good ol' days. Annglora's flora and skyscrapers can be observed from a distance, as it lacks mountains or hills that would block the view, offering a visible transition between night and day. A spectacle nobody would want to miss.

In the early morning, the city's streets come to life as people remember the beautiful bioluminescent night that just passed. The streets were painted with soft hues of emerald, indigo, and violet, creating a unique and ethereal beauty that now fades into the golden embrace of the sun. The tall skyscrapers stand tall, a symbol of the city's unyielding spirit. The bioluminescent flora, having finished their performance during the night, now await the twilight hours to showcase their beauty once again.

The absence of mountains or hills that might block the view grants Annglora a unique perspective, allowing its inhabitants and visitors alike to witness the seamless transition between night and day. It's a spectacle nobody would want to miss, and it never fails to awe those who see it. As the city emerges from the embrace of darkness, a sense of anticipation lingers—a palpable energy that signals the beginning of another chapter in Annglora's storied existence.

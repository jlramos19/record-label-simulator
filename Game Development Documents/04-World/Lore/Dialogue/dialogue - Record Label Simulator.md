“I knew evil from a very young age.”  
I was innocent, so innocent that, at times it became detrimental.  
Although I was still a kid, I had to suffer through pain very early on in my life.  
I don’t know that I have processed all the unfairness I’ve endured from the very people who were supposed to support me, but I know now that I’m ready to move forward… And do whatever it takes to get to the top of the charts.

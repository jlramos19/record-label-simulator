`[Spoken Intro]`

`Doing alright, what about you?`

`[Verse]`

 `I saw you sitting there in your grey hoodie,`

 `I thought, "Who would be dumb enough to do this?"`

 `She told me, "He's right there!" she said, "Your new king,"`

 `You turned just to pretend you weren’t looking.`

`[Pre-Chorus]`

`As I approached you, I could feel my heart as it raced,`

 `You held me tighter than my body could understand.`

`We're hot and musky, but you did not seem to care`

`Still held me tighter and nobody would understand.`

`[Chorus]`

`And the world just seemed to stop`

`And the world just seemed to stop`

`When you held me tight`

`When you held me tighter`

`[Sax Interlude]`

`[Verse]`

`I saw you sitting there in your white hoodie`

`I said “What about us” but you don’t give in`

`You told me you’re not there you have a new fling`

`I never thought your words were able to sting`

`[Pre-Chorus]`

`As I approached you I could feel my heart as it raced,`

`You held me tighter than my body could understand.`

`And I don't trust you but I never seemed to care`

`I held you tighter then cause I still had the chance`

`[Outro]`

`And the world just seemed to stop` 

`And the world just seemed to stop` 

`When you held me tight`

`When you held me tight`

`When you held me tighter`


`[Spoken]`

`I couldn't breathe`

`[Verse 1 — playful petty, glossy]`  
`You call like “you up?” like it’s casual, cute,`  
`like I’m not about to choke on the shit you’re about to do.`  
`You talk in emojis, you dodge the who/where,`  
`you’re dressing up damage like I’m supposed to care.`  
`I’m listening smiling like “mhm, okay…”`  
`while my brain goes “why the fuck would you say it this way?”`  
`You wanted a safe place, you wanted a sponge—`  
`I’m not your little clean-up when you mess up for fun.`

`[Pre-Chorus — calm, pretty, warning]`  
`Say it plain, don’t make it “soft.”`  
`Don’t drip-feed me and call it “talk.”`  
`You want me steady, you want me sweet,`  
`so you can drop the weight and land on your feet.`  
`But if I play nice, if I let it slide—`  
`you’ll come back next time with it bigger to hide.`

`[Chorus — big, chanty]`  
`Selfish stupid *****, you knew what you did,`  
`you dropped it on me like I’m built to sit with it.`  
`You wanted me quiet, you wanted me cute,`  
`you wanted me loyal while you played bulletproof.`  
`Selfish stupid *****, don’t lean on my chest,`  
`I’m not your clean conscience, I’m not your “best.”`  
`You needed relief, so you used me like this—`  
`keep that shit. I’m done with it.`

`[Verse 2 — sharper, with humor + specifics]`  
`You’re narcissistic—yeah, I said it with my teeth,`  
`’cause you always need a witness and it always has to be me.`  
`You love that I’m loyal, you love that I’m kind,`  
`you love that I’ll carry it and not blow up your life.`  
`And you act all surprised when I don’t applaud,`  
`like “wow you’re so harsh,” no bitch, you’re just wrong.`  
`You wanted my silence more than you wanted my love—`  
`that’s not a mistake, that’s a choice, that’s enough.`

`[Bridge — personal, tone drop, ex comparison]`  
`And trust, I know betrayal.`  
`My ex cheated on me with my friend…`  
`who was also his ex.`  
`So yeah, I know that “sorry” theater,`  
`the trembling voice, the “I didn’t mean it.”`  
`But at least he didn’t hand me the script and say “help me act”—`  
`you want me to hold the knife and then thank you for the cut.`

`[Final Chorus — victorious, brighter]`  
`Selfish stupid *****, you knew what you did,`  
`you dropped it on me like I’m built to sit with it.`  
`You wanted me quiet, you wanted me cute,`  
`you wanted me loyal while you played bulletproof.`  
`Selfish stupid *****, don’t lean on my chest,`  
`I’m not your clean conscience, I’m not your “best.”`  
`You needed relief, so you used me like this—`  
`keep that shit. I’m done with it.`

`song lyrics track`  
`How I don’t wanna be here`

`Is something I can’t explain`

`I thought I wanted you near`

`Cause you freed me from the pain`

`But I gotta realize`

`You will keep doing the same`

`Don’t know when you’ll stop the lies`

`Wish I’d get hit by a train` 

`I can’t trust you anymore` 

`It’s crazy you were the one`

`My mind wanted to explore`

`But caused all this to explode`

`I don’t know why I read your letters`

`don’t know why I look at the pictures`

`Because I know for sure you’ll never`

`Love me again but I still pick you`

`You`

`Come to me`

`Like you care`

`You’re still there, I see you`

`Doesn’t matter the way I try to look at it, it’s over` 

`Doesn’t matter the sense I try to find on it,` 

`If you wanna break my heart again my doors are wide open`

`Cause as long as it’s beating, my heart’s yours to rediscover`

`New`

`Colors here`

`I’m ashamed`

`Disappear, it’s in you`

`So`

`After all`

`You’re still the same`

`You tried to change` 

`It’s useless`

`Do`

`Not compare`

`The way I felt`

`With the way you think you’re feeling`

`I don’t know what to feel when you lie to me`

`It’s just shocking to know that you can do it`

`I could never betray you, no, not like that`

`But we both know we don’t feel love the same way`

`You remember the shit you did to hurt me`

`Then why and how can you continue to do it`

`[Verse]`  
`After all the hurt,`  
`After all the tears,`  
`After all the hate,`  
`After you were there.`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`We collided still,`  
`Never knew each other,`  
`You were right back then,`  
`We were never lovers.`

`[Chorus]`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still... I-`

`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`

`[Verse]`  
`I was never hurt,`  
`Never shed a tear,`  
`Never dared to hate,`  
`You when you were there,`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`We collided still,`  
`Never knew each other,`  
`I was wrong back then,`  
`Back when we were lovers.`

`[Chorus]`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still... I-`

`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`  
`I still love you`

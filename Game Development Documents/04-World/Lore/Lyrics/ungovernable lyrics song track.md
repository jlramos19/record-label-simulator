`#Verse`  
`So peaceful around`  
`So eerie yet magical`  
`The lights are still on`  
`Still empty, so tragical`

`#Pre-chorus`  
`I should get home soon`  
`But I love the moon`

`#Chorus`  
`It's incredible, a little uncomfortable`  
`The mud all over my clothes`  
`Bit regrettable, I'm ungovernable`  
`So my umbrella I close`

`#HOOK`  
`I enjoy the rain, when's the last time I did this`  
`I feel so insane, but I enjoy the abyss`

`#Verse`  
`With this I won't drown`  
`The drizzle is magical`  
`Lights soon will be gone`  
`I hate it, so tragical`

`#Pre-chorus`  
`I should get home soon`  
`But I love the moon`

`#Chorus`  
`It's incredible, a little uncomfortable`  
`The mud all over my clothes`  
`Bit regrettable, I'm ungovernable`  
`So my umbrella I close`

`#HOOK`  
`I enjoy the rain, when's the last time I did this`  
`I feel so insane, but I enjoy the abyss`

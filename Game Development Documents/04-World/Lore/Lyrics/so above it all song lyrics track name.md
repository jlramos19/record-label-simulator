\[Angered Verse\]  
No wonder everyone leaves you

You picked the petals wondering "do I love you? Do I not?"  
...well, no.

Not anymore.

\[Grumbling Pre-Chorus\]

Because you took advantage of the way I treated you  
I even gained some manners, I can say "conceited" too

\[Furious Chorus\]

You're so above it all  
And yes I love it all  
You're good as a pretender  
You're also the offender

You sliced and diced my heart  
Where do I even start?  
Though you are not that smart  
You tore it all apart

\[Post-Chorus\]

Congrats on your depart  
Won't hurt, I've seen it all  
It’s so you to withdraw  
Must be your rule of law

\[Outro\]  
I wonder who you think believes you  
The skies can't stop from thundering when you swear you're speaking facts.  
...please, stop.  
The act is done.

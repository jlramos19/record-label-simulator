\[Disappointed First Verse\]  
Deception is a curse,  
Reception just gets worse,  
You pull the strings for fun,  
I hope it brings the one.

\[Irked First Pre-Chorus\]  
Attracted to the fame,  
Adapted just as well.  
Pertaining to your point,  
It’s draining all my joy.

\[Fuming First Chorus\]  
Go ‘head and zip your mouth,  
I’m fed up with the doubts.  
You said it won’t go south,  
It led to screams and shouts\!

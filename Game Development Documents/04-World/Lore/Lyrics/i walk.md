`[Verse]`

`I walk alone`

`When I can’t sleep`

`Watching memories`

`I couldn’t keep`

`[Pre-chorus]`

`Yeah, it’s been so long`

`Since you were near,`

`This broken path`

`I chose to steer.`

`[Chorus]`

`Left the love behind, in the dead of night,`

`Burned bridges down, lost the guiding light.`

`So, I turn my eyes to the sky so wide,`

`Wish I could mend what’s torn inside`

`[Verse]`

`I searched for long,`

`far wide and deep.`

`Would not give up,`

`I wanted peace.`

`[Pre-chorus]`

`Yeah, if you think`

`you’ll always win,`

`sooner or later,`

`you’re meant to miss.`

`[Chorus]`

`I was closer then than I am right now,`

`With a missing piece and I don’t know how.`

`I look at the sky and I praise the moon,`

`for still showing up when you never do.`

# **Politics, Lottery**

`Man, it seems like nobody here has a brain`

`I don’t know if these kinda drugs cause effects`

`All I know is thinking I’ll always be trash`

`Won’t keep working, I gotta keep moving fast`

`Feels like yesterday was when I was a kid`

`I would run fast, fall down and go through the streets`

`I would stare at those pretty lights in the dark`

`And think “Wow, when is it gonna be my turn?”`

`Little did I know how all fucked up it would go,`

`All the trauma that I would have to endure,`

`And now act like all of it is in the past,`

`Cause what people want is for me to live fast.`

`Why are we all waiting for your approval?`

`What makes you think that you are that important?`

`Can I just live my life the way that I want,`

`Without you being so deep into my ass?`

`Cause what have I even done to you for you,`

`To be acting this stupid fool and uncool?`

`Don’t you see`

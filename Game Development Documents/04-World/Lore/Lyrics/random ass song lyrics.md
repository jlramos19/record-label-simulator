I’m starting to feel like you don’t want me anymore  
My body is shaking as I go and reach the door  
I spy through the creaks cause I can’t help that I’m so bored  
I know if you catch me, I’ll get scared, but you’ll ignore

I still can’t believe I haven’t seen you in so long  
That’s why I will break to dedicate to you this song  
I’m thinking I’m capable of standing here alone  
I want you to find me so you can take me along

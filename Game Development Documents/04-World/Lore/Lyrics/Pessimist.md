Despair doesn’t care about timing  
It comes at you inadvertently, but being busy could prolong its arrival  
You think you have too much time on your hands  
Maybe you needed this

Can you imagine what it would’ve been like  
If you kept yourself busy?  
But it was never meant to happen  
You were never meant to thrive

Not after all that trauma

Children are innocent, gullible even  
And in your case, you thought everyone around you had good intentions  
After all, you did  
But did you?

We all carry ulterior motives  
Whether we want to face it or not  
Maybe even children do; maybe you did as a child  
But why blame your younger self?

Was it your fault that you sought after what you wanted?  
Is it a crime to want to enjoy life?  
What did we come here for?  
To serve?

These days, you’re not good at following instructions  
But you’re actually excellent at it  
Coercion turned you into a rebel  
And loneliness has turned you evil

Frustration gets the worst out of you  
You view the world around you as a threat  
You don’t want to conform  
You hate to have to obey

You did it against your will for too long

What happens after your worst nightmare becomes a reality?  
Remember when you felt lucky  
Because your pessimism made you think that things were better than they were?  
And you thought to yourself  
“I feel so relieved.” “It didn’t actually happen.”

Catastrophe  
You face it time and time again  
Yet, when you look back  
You still think to yourself: “It could’ve been worse.”  
Could it really?

You overanalyze it, you try to rationalize it  
But deep down you know…  
You were a victim, but you don’t want to face it  
Because you’ve been told victimizing oneself is wrong

How does one process the past, then?  
Am I expected to forget about it?  
To this day, my behavior is still shaped by it  
I can’t function the way others do  
I don’t know what’s their secret  
Although I’ve seen them breaking down  
And getting back up, legs still trembling  
They can’t support their own weight

But they pretend

It’s all an act  
You’ve seen it firsthand  
When they open up to you  
You realize we’re all barely holding on

How does one lift the weight off one’s shoulder  
When we’re expected to always keep going  
The world has no time for your problems  
And the show must go on

The only way to stop time  
Is eternal slumber  
But under our current circumstances  
No matter how miserable we might be…

It’s more beneficial for us to continue to feed the machine

Most of us choose to be pacified  
It makes it easier to handle  
And keeps us stuck in a cycle  
But we don’t care, it’s normalized

If you raise your voice  
You’ll be met with consequences  
Keep your tone down  
Or find a way to sugarcoat your self-expression.

Unless you don’t fear abandonment  
It’s better to keep the peace  
Nothing good comes from starting a riot  
Not when you’re the only one at war

`I Mattered - song lyrics - track (Song Title: “I Mattered”)`

`[Verse]`  
`Autumn leaves filled the road`  
`I found it so romantic, you did not`  
`It felt so melancholic, you would not`  
`Adore the scenery how I enjoyed it`

`[Pre-Chorus]`  
`You stopped the car`  
`When would you start?`  
`We looked directly at each other but no spark (I never thought in hell is where I’d find this bar)`  
`So when would you start?`

`[Chorus]`  
`You said we hurt each other`  
`And you hated your father`  
`For talking to your mother`  
`About the things he gathered`

`From what I told your brother`  
`‘Fore all of this got madder`  
`I wasn’t trying to bother`  
`Or complicate the matter`

`But you blamed me, didn’t stutter`  
`Ignored that I was sadder`

`[Post-chorus]`  
`You didn’t like the chatter`  
`Cause you felt so much smarter`  
`I tried to reach another`  
`You who would think I mattered`

`While lost in all the clutter`  
`I didn't mean to scatter`  
`Somehow then you looked hotter`  
`So I gave in to flatter`

`Bad words at me you splattered`  
`And my delusions shattered`  
`I felt like a backstabber`  
`I thought you said I mattered:`

`Why did you have to wait so long?`  
`Now I have to write you this song`  
`It doesn’t matter cause you’re gone`

`My…`  
`Heart couldn’t take it anymore`  
`I felt you walking through the door`  
`Is it cause you finally got bored?`

`Lie!`  
`Do it again, I won’t ignore`  
`The way you do it to get more`  
`you know you’re still who I adore`

`I just can’t… see you look at me`   
`And not feel that thing`   
`That thing that we felt when things were good, things were great, yeah so great`

`I might’ve been dreaming`   
`My glasses are off`  
`I see that you’re speeding`  
`Or you just shut off`

`I read between the lines`   
`While you send all the signs`

`I know you’re tired`  
`I’m tired too`  
`But I desired`  
`For us two`

`To be together`   
`and last forever` 

`But we don’t feel the same`   
`At least not anymore`   
`Did we do this in vain?`  
`Or were you keeping score?`

`Can I tell you a secret?`  
`I got resentful too`  
`When you told me you’d be there`  
`But now I just feel… blue`

`I wish you were able to tell me what’s wrong`  
`It might just be too late`   
`I can’t process the fact that we’re done`   
`it makes me feel so lame` 

`I feel butterflies in my stomach`   
`I wish they were all dead`  
`Cause I don’t know how I can stomach`  
`Hearing you lie in my bed` 

`And I just wonder`  
`Why did we do that?`  
`I’d have to ponder`  
`Was I too fat?`

`I’m so fucking sad`  
`Frustrated even`  
`I want you so bad`  
`But what’s the reason?`

`Song Lyrics Track (untitled song draft)`

`I don’t know where to start`  
`I have so much to say`  
`I have so many scars`  
`It feels like yesterday`  
`When I was in your car`  
`With so much love to spare`  
`But now it seems so hard`  
`Just to look at your face`

`You’re not here anymore`  
`But I don’t give up on you`  
`You told me you were bored`  
`Well, I’ll say I was bored too`

`It seems`  
`Like the only experience that matters is your own`  
`It feels`  
`Like the decent moments that we shared were all so wrong` 

`Did you ever truly love me?`  
`I sit down here and wonder`   
`No matter how much you say it`  
`If you don’t help me believe it`

`They say actions speak louder than words`  
`I was deaf and blind seeking your love`  
`And somehow it makes me want you more`  
`I would’ve preferred for you to stay bored`

## **`Section 2: Structural Analysis (forms, verse/chorus patterns, rhyme, meter)`**

* `Song Sections & Format: Most of these lyrics are structured into clearly marked sections such as verses, choruses, and often pre-choruses or bridges. For example, songs like “Stay” and “I Fear” explicitly label sections like [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], etc . A typical layout is verse → pre-chorus → chorus, sometimes with a bridge and an outro. Several songs (e.g. “I Fear”, “Something to Work With”) even include an [Intro] and/or [Outro] section , indicating a penchant for framing the song with a clear beginning or closing segment.`

* `Use of Repetition: Choruses and other key sections are frequently repeated. Many songs present a full chorus and then repeat it later verbatim (for instance, “Stay” repeats its pre-chorus and chorus a second time, exactly the same words ). This shows a conventional pop-song structure where the chorus acts as a familiar anchor. In “Something to Work With,” the chorus and post-chorus are both repeated after the bridge . The writer usually writes these repeated sections out in full, rather than using shorthand, which underscores their importance and ensures the lyric document reads as a complete performance script.`

* `Section Variations: While most songs have at least one verse and one chorus, some skip a second verse or replace it with a bridge or extended chorus. For example, “Stay” goes from a single verse into a bridge and then back to the chorus, without a second distinct verse section . “I Mattered” only features one main verse and then moves through pre-chorus, chorus, and post-chorus without returning to a new verse , suggesting it might be a partial draft or an intentionally brief form. In contrast, “I Fear” and “Adapt” each include two verses (Verse 1 and Verse 2) separated by choruses , following a more traditional two-verse structure. The song “When You Look At Me” exists in two versions: an earlier draft with detailed mood labels for each section and a final version that streamlines those sections (combining the “Hopeful Pre-Chorus” into a later bridge, for example) . This indicates that the writer experiments with section order and labeling during drafting, then refines the structure in the final version.`

* `Rhyme Schemes: The lyrics demonstrate simple but effective rhyme schemes within sections. Often, pairs of lines or alternating lines rhyme with each other. For instance, in “Blue,” one stanza uses an AABB rhyme pattern: “You don’t say it that way” and “I can see you stray” (way/stray), followed by “I read between the lines” and “While you send all the signs” (lines/signs) . In “When You Look At Me,” the bridge rhymes “emotion” with “motion” and “near” with “beer” in an alternating ABAB pattern . Not every line is rhymed, but the songwriter often ensures that each section has at least some end-rhyme pairs or repeated end sounds to create a sense of cohesion. Sometimes identical words are repeated as rhymes (for example, using “here” at the end of two lines in a row ). The approach to rhyme is relatively straightforward – favoring easy-to-hear rhymes or repetition – rather than complex or multi-syllabic rhymes.`

* `Meter & Line Length: The line lengths tend to be moderate and rhythm-friendly, usually one short phrase per line. There is no strict syllable count, but lines generally stay within a similar range in a given section. For example, the verse lines in “Stay” are all brief, four to six words each , which keeps a steady rhythm. The songwriter occasionally uses punctuation or formatting to indicate phrasing or pauses – such as an ellipsis in “Blue” (“I just can’t… see you look at me”) to show a vocal or emotional pause. In “Adapt,” a hyphen is used at the end of a bridge line (“seeing me adapt-”) , implying the word “adapt” trails into the next section. These textual cues suggest the intended pacing or emphasis. Overall, the meter is conversational; the lyrics flow as one would speak or sing naturally, rather than adhering to a rigid poetic meter, but there is a clear sense of rhythmic structure given the consistent section patterns and line-breaks.`

## **`Section 3: Language and Phrasing Patterns`**

* `Perspective and Voice: The lyrics are overwhelmingly written in the first person, addressing a second person (“you”). The narrator is almost always “I,” speaking directly to a “you” – usually a loved one or former loved one. For example, “I know you’re tired, I’m tired too” or “I just want to hear that you want me near” . This direct address creates an intimate, conversational tone. There are occasional references to third persons (like a “she” in “I Fear” or family members in “I Mattered” ), but these are mentioned in the context of the first person’s relationship to the second person. The consistent use of first and second person pronouns across songs gives the lyrics a personal, confessional quality, as if the songwriter is speaking or pleading directly to someone.`

* `Tone and Diction: The language is straightforward and conversational, often mirroring everyday speech. Contractions (“you’re,” “don’t,” “I’m”) are used frequently, and the tone can be candidly emotional. The songwriter doesn’t shy away from strong language or swearing when it conveys the feeling – for instance, “I’m so fucking sad” in “Blue” . This choice of words intensifies the raw emotion. Generally, the diction is not overly poetic or abstract; instead, it’s plain-spoken with moments of colloquial flair (e.g. “What’s the reason?” , “You know you won’t miss” ). This makes the emotional content feel authentic and unfiltered.`

* `Use of Questions and Pleas: Many songs include rhetorical questions, pleas, or calls to action directed at the “you” in question. The narrator often asks questions that reveal vulnerability or confusion, such as “Do you think you can look at me again…?” or “Did we do this in vain?” . These questions usually express doubt or seek reassurance. Similarly, there are frequent pleading statements and imperatives: “Can you talk to me, please? / Let’s work it through” or “Beg me to stay / Tell me you really do wish I would stay” . Words like “please,” or phrases like “I just want to hear you…” underline a desperate desire for communication or change. This pattern of questioning and pleading gives the lyrics a dramatic, urgent tone, as if the songwriter is actively trying to engage the other person in a dialogue or persuade them of something.`

* `Repetition and Emphasis: The songwriter frequently uses repetition for emotional effect. Sometimes entire lines or phrases repeat, as in the double call “Stay inside, stay inside” or “Stay right here, stay right here” in the chorus of “Stay,” emphasizing urgency. Other times, a phrase is repeated within a line: “Don’t you know that, Everybody knows that” , or “I said I do know but I don’t know” repeated multiple times in “I Fear” . This technique reinforces the central feelings or messages (for example, underscoring how universally known the secret is in “I Fear,” or the insistence on not leaving in “Stay”). The writer also employs parallel structure – several lines starting with the same few words – which gives a rhythmic, almost musical chant quality. In “Adapt,” four chorus lines in a row begin with “And I…” , which creates a persistent, driving emphasis. Overall, repetition is a key part of the phrasing, driving the emotional point home and making lines more memorable.`

* `Imagery and Figurative Language: While the language is mostly direct, the songwriter does incorporate simple imagery and metaphor to illustrate emotions. These are often grounded in everyday experiences. For example, physical settings and actions appear: driving scenes (“Autumn leaves filled the road” , “You stopped the car” ), a haunted house scenario in “Stay” (“This house is haunted… outside it’s so dark right now” ), or drinking imagery (“finish this beer” in “When You Look at Me” ). These concrete images help set a scene for the emotional exchange. We also see metaphors like having “butterflies in my stomach, I wish they were all dead” to convey anxiety turned sour , or “I was deaf and blind seeking your love” to express ignorance to red flags. The lyrics sometimes use hyperbole or strong imagery (“they will kill you in under an hour” in “Stay”) to dramatize feelings of danger or desperation. In general, the figurative language is relatable and not overly abstract – it serves to amplify the emotional state in a way the listener can visualize easily.`

## **`Section 4: Emotional and Thematic Patterns`**

* `Heartbreak and Loss: A central theme across almost all these songs is romantic heartbreak or the painful loss of a relationship. The narrator often speaks from a place of hurt due to a failing or ended relationship. In “Blue,” for instance, the entire lyric is a reaction to a partner’s departure – “It doesn’t matter cause you’re gone” encapsulates that sense of loss. The title itself (“Blue”) is directly referenced at the end as the narrator’s emotional state . Similarly, in the untitled draft, the line “You’re not here anymore” plainly states the absence of the loved one. Many songs question the breakup or express inability to move on (“I can’t process the fact that we’re done” ). This recurring theme of heartbreak is usually conveyed with sadness and often confusion, as the narrator tries to understand why things fell apart (“Why did we do that? … Was I too fat?” shows personal insecurity and searching for reasons ).`

* `Longing and Pleading: Alongside heartbreak is a strong theme of longing for the other person and pleading for reconciliation or understanding. The narrator frequently begs the other person to stay, to listen, or to return affection. For example, the song “When You Look At Me” is essentially a plea for the partner to look at the narrator the way they used to, with lines like “Do I have to plead? I just want to hear that you want me near” . In “Something to Work With,” the chorus implores the partner to “Speak up for once” and “Give me something to work with” , indicating the narrator’s desperate hope to fix the relationship if given any sign to hold onto. The emotional tone here is one of earnest yearning – the narrator hasn’t given up and is actively asking the other person for effort or clarity to save what they have. This pattern of begging or urging the partner to stay (“Beg me to stay / Tell me you really do wish I would stay” ) appears in multiple songs, highlighting a fear of abandonment and a deep desire to reconnect.`

* `Frustration and Conflict: Many lyrics also display frustration, anger, or conflict within the relationship. The narrator often calls out the other person’s behavior in a hurt tone. In “I Mattered,” there is resentment that the partner blamed the narrator unfairly (“But you blamed me, didn’t stutter, Ignored that I was sadder” ). “Blue” swings between sorrow and flashes of anger or bitterness – telling the partner “Do it again, I won’t ignore the way you do it to get more” suggests a fed-up tone about manipulative behavior . There’s also self-directed frustration; the narrator in “Blue” wonders if they were at fault (“Was I too fat?” shows a moment of insecure frustration). In “Adapt,” the tone is weary and resigned but also bitter about the need to change for someone (“I hate to become loose yet not enough. And I get that you will choose to still move on.” ). Throughout these songs, conflict often stems from feeling unvalued or mistreated by the partner. The emotional palette here is not just sadness but also irritation at being hurt. This adds a layer of complexity – the narrator isn’t just wallowing; they are also pushing back, questioning, or calling out injustices (“You think you know power but you need reason” in “Stay,” spoken to someone arrogant ).`

* `Self-Reflection and Insecurity: Intertwined with addressing the partner, the lyrics often reveal the narrator’s self-doubt and introspection. They question their own actions or worth in the relationship. For example, lines like “I’d have to ponder, Was I too fat?” or “No matter how much you say it, if you don’t help me believe it” indicate insecurity and the need for validation. The narrator wonders if they were the problem or if they could have done something differently. In “I Fear,” although the song outwardly is about silencing someone threatening to reveal a secret, it indirectly shows the narrator’s fear of judgment and the lengths they go to own their narrative (spray-painting the secret on the wall themselves) . This is a form of self-assertion born from insecurity. The emotional theme here is that the songwriter’s characters often battle internal fears (of not being good enough, of being left, of being judged) and those fears are laid bare in the lyrics.`

* `Hope and Defiance: Despite the predominant melancholy, a few moments of hope or defiance shine through. The narrator sometimes clings to hope that things can improve – as seen in “Something to Work With” (“I know we can work it out until May is here” , which suggests believing there’s still time to fix things) – or imagines a reconciliation (the very plea of “When You Look At Me” assumes it’s possible to return to better days ). In “I Fear,” there’s a tone of defiance: the narrator takes control by saying “You can’t tell my secret, I own the megaphone” , showing empowerment in the face of potential hurt. Similarly, the act of urging someone to “stay inside” in “Stay” can be seen as protective defiance against external threats . These moments show that the songwriting isn’t one-note despair; there are shades of resilience. However, these hopeful or strong moments are often tempered by reality – for example, “Adapt” ends with acceptance that the other person will “still move on” . Overall, the emotional journey in each lyric tends to oscillate between hope and disappointment, but even the presence of hope indicates the narrator’s depth of feeling and unwillingness to let go easily.`

## **`Section 5: Draft Analysis`**

`Several of the documents appear to be draft or incomplete works. Below is an analysis of each draft and its potential:`

* `“Blue - song lyrics track”: This piece stands out as less formally structured – there are no section labels like verse or chorus, and the narrative flows in a more freeform way . It reads like a stream of consciousness from the narrator after a breakup, with raw transitions between thoughts (abruptly shifting from pleading to anger and back). Lines like “I just can’t… see you look at me” use an ellipsis mid-line , which suggests the writer might have been capturing an unfiltered emotional outburst. The lack of a defined chorus or repeated hook implies this might be an early draft or a songwriting exercise where the writer poured out feelings without refining the structure yet. Despite that, it’s quite lengthy and contains some rhyme and cohesive stanzas, so it could be developed into a full song. Salvageability: High. The emotional content is rich. To finalize it, the writer could identify a chorus within those lines (perhaps the “Just seems like… last goodbye” section or the “I’m so fucking sad…” part as a climax ) and build clearer verses around it. The draft already has compelling lines; it mostly needs tightening into the verse-chorus form used in the other songs.`

* `“I Mattered - song lyrics - track”: This song is structured with labeled sections but appears to end abruptly after the first cycle of verse→chorus. There is only one verse and one chorus in the document, plus a pre-chorus and post-chorus . Typically, one would expect a second verse or a bridge after the first chorus, but here the song stops with the line “I thought you said I mattered:” , which ends on a colon. Ending on a colon gives the impression of an unfinished thought, reinforcing the idea that this is a draft that wasn’t completed. Perhaps the writer intended to add more (like a second verse or a resolving bridge) but never did, or they deliberately left a hanging ending for effect. Salvageability: Moderate to high. The content that exists is strong – the theme of feeling like one mattered to someone (and then realizing maybe not) is clear and relatable. To complete it, the writer could add a second verse expanding on the story or an outro that resolves the hanging “mattered:” line (for instance, answering or refuting it). If the open-ended finish was intentional, they might still want to ensure the song feels complete musically. As is, it feels more like a first half of a song.`

* `“When You Look At Me - Song Lyrics - Track”: This is clearly a draft version of the song “When You Look At Me.” It contains essentially the same lyrics as the final version, but with each section labeled by mood (Sad Intro, Hopeful Pre-Chorus, Nostalgic Chorus, etc.) and some sections repeated that were later condensed . For example, the draft has both a “Hopeful Pre-Chorus” and an “Eager Pre-Chorus” (for verse 1 and 2 respectively) whereas the final version drops the pre-chorus in the first verse and uses that segment later as a single bridge . The presence of descriptive adjectives in the section labels suggests the writer was planning the emotional progression of the song in this draft. This version is actually fully fleshed out (all lyrics present), so it’s not incomplete in content – it’s just an earlier arrangement. Salvageability: Already high, since it evolved into the final song. The draft itself is coherent and could stand as an alternate version. The fact that it was refined into the version without the mood labels indicates the writer successfully “salvaged” it by streamlining the structure. The draft serves as a great example of the writer working through ideas; nothing here needed discarding so much as reorganizing, which they did.`

* `“Song lyrics track” (two-line untitled fragment): This Google Doc contains only two lines: “I hate that I convince myself / That sometimes you don’t need the help” . It reads like a single couplet extracted from a thought. There’s no context or continuation, so it appears to be just a snippet jotted down – perhaps an idea for a verse or a hook that the writer hasn’t expanded on yet. Salvageability: Hard to judge with so little content, but those two lines present an intriguing emotional concept (possibly about self-deception and refusing help). This fragment could potentially grow into a verse in a larger song about pride or denial. On its own, it’s obviously not a full song. It’s salvageable in the sense that it can be incorporated into a new work, but it would need a lot of development (additional lyrics, context, and structure).`

* `“Song Lyrics Track” (untitled song draft): This document has multiple stanzas of lyrics without any labels, looking like a work-in-progress full song . It features distinct sections separated by blank lines (several verses and possibly a chorus), but the writer hasn’t labeled which part is the chorus or verse. Reading it, one can guess that certain lines might function as a chorus – for example, the question “Did you ever truly love me? I sit down here and wonder…” could be a refrain given its impact. However, since nothing is repeated or marked, it’s likely the writer hadn’t settled on the final structure yet. Thematically, it covers heartbreak and doubt, similar to the other songs. Salvageability: High. The draft is quite close to a complete lyric; it has multiple stanzas that could be verses and a potential chorus or bridge. To finalize this, the writer would need to pick a chorus (perhaps by highlighting one of the more impactful stanzas and repeating it) and maybe add a title that reflects a key phrase (“Stay Bored” could be a candidate, given the last line “I would’ve preferred for you to stay bored” ). With some section labeling and maybe minor tweaks, this draft could become a finished song very much in line with the others.`

## **`Section 6: Songwriting Style “Rulebook”`**

`Based on the above analysis, here is a distilled “rulebook” of your songwriting style – essentially the consistent guidelines you appear to follow when crafting lyrics:`

1. `Write in the First Person to “You”: Almost every song is written from an “I” perspective addressing a “you.” This direct second-person address makes the songs feel personal and conversational, as if speaking or pleading directly to the subject.`

2. `Structure with Clear Sections: You organize songs into clear structural parts – typically verses, pre-choruses, choruses, and often a bridge – and you label them explicitly. Even drafts show a conscious awareness of song form. Intros and outros are used when needed to set the scene or conclude the story.`

3. `Emotional Trajectory Planning: You often map out the emotional tone of each section (sometimes literally labeling sections with moods in drafts). Your songs usually move through a trajectory (e.g., sad and pleading in verses, a surge of hope or nostalgia in the chorus, maybe a final tone of resignation in the outro).`

4. `Repetition for Emphasis: You frequently use repetition – whether repeating a line, a phrase, or a chorus – to underline the emotional core of the song. Key lines or hooks are often stated multiple times to drive the message home and make the song memorable.`

5. `Simple Rhyme and Conversational Meter: Your rhymes are usually straightforward (end-of-line rhymes or even repeated words) and you don’t force complex poetic structures. Lines are kept at a moderate length and phrased in natural, spoken rhythms. This makes your lyrics easy to sing and understand, prioritizing feeling over fancy wordplay.`

6. `Honest, Unfiltered Language: You use plain, relatable language and are not afraid to include colloquialisms, slang, or even profanity when it conveys the intensity of emotion. The tone is candid – you express vulnerability, frustration, and desire without dressing it up in obscure metaphor.`

7. `Strong Imagery and Scenarios: While staying straightforward, you often include concrete imagery or situational details (cars, houses, bars, physical actions) to ground your songs in a real context. These little story elements help listeners visualize the scenario and feel the emotion more vividly.`

8. `Core Themes of Heartache and Yearning: Your songs consistently revolve around emotional relationships – usually troubled ones. Common threads are heartbreak, betrayal, longing for someone, and trying to fix or understand a failing relationship. There’s often a mix of sorrow, desire, and frustration present, giving your songs an emotionally charged atmosphere.`

9. `Dynamic Emotional Range: Within a song, you cover a spectrum of feelings – from vulnerable pleas and hope to anger and resignation. This dynamic range is planned (for example, a hopeful section might be followed by a disappointed one). It keeps the narrative engaging and mirrors the real ups and downs of relationship turmoil.`

10. `Drafting as Part of the Process: Your approach to songwriting involves drafting and refining. Initial drafts might include extra notes (like emotional labels or scattered ideas) which you then polish into the final lyrics. You ensure the final product has a logical flow and structure, even if the first draft was exploratory. In other words, you start by getting the raw ideas out, then iteratively shape them into the cohesive songs we see in the finished versions.`

`You’re right — I missed some, including Lucky Charm, even though it clearly matches the “song lyrics track” pattern. I’ll fix that now without changing anything you already wrote, and I’ll keep the same structure you asked for.`

`I’m going to:`

* `Add an addendum to Section 1 with the missing songs’ full lyrics (exact copy).`

* `Then add addenda to Sections 2–6 showing how those extra songs refine or extend the analysis.`

`I won’t restate the songs I already covered (Blue, I Fear, When You Look At Me, Something to Work With, I Mattered, Stay, Adapt, the 2-line fragment, and the longer unlabeled “Song Lyrics Track”); I’ll only add what was missing.`

## **`Section 2 – Structural Analysis (Addendum)`**

`New songs reinforce and slightly expand the earlier structural picture:`

* `Verse-only or verse+outro format:`

   `Lucky Charm has three labeled verses and an outro, but no labeled chorus or repeated refrain. All four sections use a rigid internal rhyme pattern built on “-ill” (“skill / chill / kill / died”, “will / bill / drill / still”, “pill / will / thrill / ill”, “hill / until”) which gives the song its structural hook instead of a separate chorus.` 

* `Pre-chorus/chorus refinement:`

   `Love Note, Uh-oh, His Kiss, Magnetic, and Why Did I all follow classic pop forms:`

  * `Verse → pre-chorus → chorus, with repeats later.`

  * `Some add bridges and alternate chorus moods (e.g. “relaxed and calmer chorus” vs “tenser and angrier chorus” in Why Did I).` 

     `Magnetic extends this with multiple pre-chorus “continues,” plus a chorus-outro.` 

* `Labeling emotional intent:`

   `As with the draft of When You Look At Me, Why Did I labels sections by emotional color: “relaxed and calmer chorus”, “agonizing bridge”, “sexier pre-chorus”, “tenser and angrier chorus”, “exhausted outro.” This confirms a recurring habit of marking sections with emotional role in drafts.` 

* `Short, unlabeled fragments:`

   `The two “Song lyrics track” fragments (How I don’t wanna be here… / I no longer know you…) and Open have no section labels and are short, standalone stanzas. These appear as idea kernels rather than full structures.`     

`Overall, the new material confirms: you usually write in standard pop structures with clear section labeling, but you’re comfortable using verse-only forms (Lucky Charm) and unlabeled free stanzas when you’re capturing ideas or building something more linear.`

---

## **`Section 3 – Language and Phrasing Patterns (Addendum)`**

`The additional songs sharpen some patterns and add a few new ones:`

* `Dense internal rhyme / repeated sounds:`

   `Lucky Charm is built almost entirely on “-ill” / “-ide” internal rhymes (“skill / chill / kill / died”, “will / bill / drill / still”, “pill / will / thrill / ill / disguise”, etc.), creating a strong rhythmic and phonetic grid inside the verses.` 

* `Wordplay and punning:`

   `Open explicitly plays with “Open / Oh pen” – the title word becomes a pun on “Oh pen,” talking to the writing tool as if it’s a person:`

   `“Open / It’s open … Oh pen / I wish you wouldn’t make me say all these words”` 

   `That’s a more overt linguistic joke than in most of the other songs, but it still fits your pattern of talking directly to abstract things (love notes, letters, etc.) as if they were (deprecated term).`

* `Concrete symbolic objects:`

   `New recurring objects:`

  * `Love note as a concrete anchor in Love Note (“it’s your love note that keeps me stuck”).` 

  * `Pill / will / hill in Lucky Charm tying mental health, death fantasy, and location imagery together.` 

  * `Pen in Open, personified as “opportunistic motherfucker you were here while I chose to let everyone take the very best of me.”` 

* `Section-label adjectives:`

   `Why Did I repeats the pattern seen in the draft When You Look At Me: section labels describe the feel of performance (“agonizing bridge,” “sexier pre-chorus,” etc.). This shows up specifically in drafts rather than in “final” files, so it looks like a working language you use for yourself.` 

`The main earlier conclusions still hold: first-person voice, direct address to “you,” conversational diction, strong use of questions and repetition, with the new material highlighting your comfort with phonetic chains (Lucky Charm) and meta-writing language (Open).`

---

## **`Section 4 – Emotional and Thematic Patterns (Addendum)`**

`These songs deepen the emotional palette but stay in the same universe:`

* `Manipulation and toxicity named explicitly:`

   `Lucky Charm calls the other person a “manipulator in disguise” and describes their pain as a “lucky charm” they keep inside. The narrator simultaneously sees their behavior as harmful (“You make me ill”) and remains emotionally attached (“I love you still, the only truth I can’t deny”).` 

* `Attachment to written/recorded traces:`

   `Multiple songs hinge on written or symbolic traces of the relationship:`

  * `The love note that “keeps me stuck” in Love Note.` 

  * `Reading letters and looking at pictures despite knowing “you’ll never love me again” in the unlabeled “song lyrics track.”` 

  * `Addressing the pen in Open and blaming it for making you access locked-up words.` 

     `This reinforces a theme where written artifacts (notes, letters, documents) hold emotional power and keep you tied to someone.`

* `Queer desire stated directly:`

   `His Kiss and Why Did I both explicitly frame male–male attraction (“I just want his kiss,” “lying in bed with another… guy”).`   

   `The emotional material is the same heartbreak/obsession territory as your other songs, but the gender of the desired person is explicit rather than implied, which is a clear part of the content.`

* `Self-destructive or death-tinged imagery:`

   `This shows up more strongly with the new material:`

  * `“Wish I’d get hit by a train” in the unlabeled track.` 

  * `“I’ll write the will a little later, don’t ask why” and “on a hill, my heart still beating for you dies” in Lucky Charm.` 

     `Those are clear textual references to fantasized harm / death linked to heartbreak.`

* `Shifts from longing to reclamation:`

   `Magnetic and Open are more about reclaiming self than begging for the person to stay.`

  * `In Magnetic the narrator gradually moves to “I’m my own guide, yeah, you screwed up forever… I’m negative, you’re no longer magnetic.”` 

  * `In Open there’s a turn from vulnerability (“You will never know when I’ll get brave enough to cut open this wound”) to criticizing the pen and the pattern of letting people “take the very best of me.”` 

     `So while heartbreak is still central, there are clear texts that move toward boundary-setting and exit.`

`The new songs don’t contradict the original thematic read; they mainly intensify (more explicit manipulation and self-destruction) and broaden (more clear self-reclamation, more meta-writing themes).`

## **`Section 5 – Draft Analysis (Addendum / Clarifications)`**

`Focusing only on the newly discussed files:`

1. `Lucky Charm song lyrics track`

   * `Evidence of draft vs. complete:`

     * `Has [First Verse], [Second Verse], [Third Verse], [Outro], but no section labeled “Chorus” or “Pre-Chorus” and no repeated text blocks.` 

   * `From the document alone, it’s impossible to tell whether you intended a chorus or whether the rigid verse pattern is the design. Structurally, the internal rhyme chain gives it a strong identity even without a chorus.`

   * `Salvage / readiness: fully coherent as a linear lyric. It can stand as a song that leans on a verse hook (the “-ill” chain) instead of a traditional chorus. If you wanted, you could still pull a chorus out of one of the couplets, but nothing in the file requires that.`

2. `Love Note song lyrics track`

   * `Clear, standard structure: two verses, a repeated pre-chorus, repeated chorus, and a short bridge.`   

   * `No hanging punctuation or obviously truncated thoughts.`

   * `Conclusion: reads as a finished lyric, not a draft.`

3. `Uh-oh – Song Lyrics Track`

   * `Structure: two verses, one pre-chorus leading into the chorus, a post-chorus hook (“Uh-oh…”), then a second verse, a bridge, and an outro that reprises the “Uh-oh” hook.` 

   * `Again, no unfinished lines or sudden cutoffs.`

   * `Conclusion: looks fully structured and self-contained.`

4. `Song Lyrics track – His Kiss`

   * `Has verse → pre-chorus → chorus → verse → pre-chorus → chorus → outro.`   

   * `Lyrics end on a short, deliberate echo (“Hi-his kiss…”). No incomplete sentence or trailing colon.`

   * `Conclusion: appears like a completed draft or final lyric.`

5. `Magnetic – song lyrics track`

   * `Contains intro, multiple verses, multiple pre-choruses, two choruses, two post-choruses, a bridge, a third verse, a final pre-chorus and a “Chorus Outro”.`   

   * `The structure is detailed and consistent.`

   * `Conclusion: reads as an intentionally complete arrangement, not a sketch.`

6. `song lyrics track (How I don’t wanna be here…)`

   * `One continuous piece, no section labels. It ends on a complete sentence (“Love me again but I still pick you”) without obvious truncation.` 

   * `Compared to your other work, it lacks a chorus and looks like a single long verse or proto-song.`

   * `Conclusion: could be interpreted as a finished freeform lyric, but relative to your usual sectioned structure it functions more like a draft/idea that could be split into sections later.`

7. `Song lyrics track (I no longer know you…)`

   * `Only 8 lines total, no title beyond the generic one, no section markers.` 

   * `Conclusion: clearly a fragment, likely an opening verse or stanza idea rather than a complete song. Salvage: the lines are coherent and fit your themes, so they could become a verse in a future track.`

8. `Open song lyrics track`

   * `Two blocks of text, no section labels, conceptually cohesive around “open/Oh pen”.` 

   * `The second block ends on a complete line (“Large amounts of grief while trying to fix it”) but nothing suggests chorus/structure decisions yet.`

   * `Conclusion: reads as an idea piece or early draft – strong concept and voice, but no sign in the document that a full song structure has been chosen yet.`

9. `Why Did I – Song Lyrics – Track`

   * `Fully structured: intro, first verse, pre-chorus, labeled chorus, bridge, second pre-chorus (different tone), second chorus (different tone), and an outro.`   

   * `Emotional labels on sections signal it’s a detailed draft, but nothing in the text suggests missing parts.`

   * `Conclusion: content-complete; if it’s a “draft,” it’s at the polishing/arrangement stage, not the sketch stage.`

10. `I Mattered – song lyrics track version 2`

    * `This is not a new song but a more clearly segmented version of I Mattered: it splits the chorus into three separate labeled [Chorus] blocks and the post-chorus into three [Post-chorus] blocks.` 

    * `The lyric ends on a full line (“I thought you said I mattered”) without a colon.`

    * `Conclusion: compared to the earlier version ending in a colon, this version looks more finalized in terms of punctuation and section clarity.`

## **`Section 6 – Updated “Rulebook” (Only Changes / Reinforcements)`**

`All original “rules” still hold. The extra songs let us sharpen a few points, staying strictly within what’s on the page:`

1. `You sometimes replace a chorus with a strict internal-rhyme engine (e.g., Lucky Charm’s stacked “-ill” quatrains) instead of repeated hooks.`

2. `In drafts, you annotate sections with emotional labels (sad/hopeful/eager/agonizing/sexier/angrier/exhausted) as part of your working process, then strip those labels for final versions.`   

3. `You have a recurring meta-writing motif: love notes, letters, pictures, and pens are all explicitly referenced as things that keep you stuck, force you to express, or store emotional energy.`     

4. `Some lyrics are intentionally freeform or fragmentary (short 4–8 line pieces, or unsectioned blocks like Open), suggesting a habit of storing raw stanzas separately from fully structured songs rather than forcing everything into a pop form immediately.`

`So yes — Lucky Charm and the others absolutely belong in the picture, and pulling them in just reinforces how consistent you are across the whole folder while also showing a few extra tools you use (puns, dense internal rhyme, death/illness imagery, and meta-writing themes).`

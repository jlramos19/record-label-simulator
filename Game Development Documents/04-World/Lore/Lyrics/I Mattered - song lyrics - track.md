\[Verse\]  
Autumn leaves filled the road  
I found it so romantic, you did not  
It felt so melancholic, you would not  
Adore the scenery how I enjoyed it

\[Pre-Chorus\]  
You stopped the car  
When would you start?  
We looked directly at each other but no spark (I never thought in hell is where I’d find this bar)  
So when would you start?

\[Chorus\]  
You said we hurt each other  
And you hated your father  
For talking to your mother  
About the things he gathered

From what I told your brother  
‘Fore all of this got madder  
I wasn’t trying to bother  
Or complicate the matter

But you blamed me, didn’t stutter  
Ignored that I was sadder

\[Post-chorus\]  
You didn’t like the chatter  
Cause you felt so much smarter  
I tried to reach another  
You who would think I mattered

While lost in all the clutter  
I didn't mean to scatter  
Somehow then you looked hotter  
So I gave in to flatter

Bad words at me you splattered  
And my delusions shattered  
I felt like a backstabber  
I thought you said I mattered:

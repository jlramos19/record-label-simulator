\[Verse 1\]  
You don’t know it  
Oh, but I do  
That our story  
Wasn’t of two

I put the money  
Everything cool  
First, say you love me  
Now, say we’re through

\[Pre-Chorus\]  
No, I don’t mind, I am not hurt  
Trust me, you’re fine. We have been there  
Don’t gotta lie, this is a step  
All of the guys said we would face

Wait, what was that? I have not heard  
…you saying that since the bad days  
I think my heart will take the blame  
And realize this is the end

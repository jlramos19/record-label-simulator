**`1st Album: Faint of Heart`**  
*`Track 01. Me and Myself Later`*

**`[Verse 1]`**  
`I opened my mouth`  
`Everything went south`  
`I tried to climb`  
`Committed a crime`

**`[Pre-Chorus]`**  
`You fill your mouth calling me selfish`  
`I look back and say “yes, I am”`  
`‘Cause for those compliments I won’t fish`

`[Chorus]`  
`I see the way he plays it cool, ah`  
`Heart of ice, he's breaking rules, yeah`  
`Got my pulse racing, it's so cruel, ah`  
`But I'm no fool, he's got that jewel, yeah`

`[Verse]`  
`Mother of mine, enlighten me`  
`My heart is racing out of here`  
`The way he sneaks into my life`  
`I cannot fight it if I tried`

`[Chorus]`  
`I see the way he plays it cool, ah`  
`Heart of ice, he's breaking rules, yeah`  
`Got my pulse racing, it's so cruel, ah`  
`But I'm no fool, he's got that jewel, yeah`

`[Outro]`  
`He strides, he glides, that sly reply`  
`Three voices blending in the night`  
`My senses feel the sharpest when`  
`The fear is lingering behind`

`It's him, it's you, it's me, I see`  
`I'm crazy but I touch the fire`  
`It burns, it's hot, consuming me`  
`It kills me but I feel alive`

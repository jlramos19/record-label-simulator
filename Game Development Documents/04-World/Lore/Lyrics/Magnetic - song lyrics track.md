`[Intro]`  
`Part of me just wants to let you,`  
`Pardon, you must count your virtues,`  
`Not the amount you hoped to get to,`  
`Face the fact now. We both know who’s who.`  

`[First Verse]`  
`Why must I be,`  
`The one who knows,`  
`And takes the lead,`  
`Carrying this show?`

`[First Prechorus]`  
`Turn it around,`  
`Ask to yourself.`  
`Is it too loud?`  
`You made a mess.`

`[Continued First Prechorus]`  
`Feeling so down,`  
`But here’s what’s next.`  
`Put on this gown and hope for the best!`

`[First Chorus]`  
`Marry the night, yeah, they told me it’s better.`  
`I’m my own guide, yeah, you screwed up forever.`  
`It’s additive; your excuses? Pathetic.`  
`I’m negative, you’re no longer magnetic.`

`[First Post-chorus]`  
`I hate to say…`  
`I hate to say…`

`[Second Verse]`  
`I hate to say,`  
`but yes, you were…`  
`The one who said:`  
`“Hey, babe. okay.”`

`[Second Prechorus]`  
`Give it up now,`  
`Keep to yourself,`  
`You’re not allowed,`  
`To cause me stress.`

`[Continued Second Prechorus]`  
`Was feeling down,`  
`But here’s what’s next.`  
`Try that one out and hope for the best!`

`[Second Chorus]`  
`Marry the night, yeah, they told me it’s better.`  
`I’m my own guide, yeah, you screwed up forever.`  
`It’s additive; your excuses? Pathetic.`  
`I’m negative, you’re no longer magnetic.`

`[Bridge]`  
`Part of me just wants to let you,`  
`Hey don't act lost, count your virtues,`  
`Don’t distract me now you get to,`  
`Face the facts we… all know who’s who.`

`[Second Post-chorus]`  
`So this is it…`  
`So this is it…`

`[Third Verse]`  
`So this is it,`  
`Round of applause.`  
`Now, what a hit,`  
`Yeah, you’re the boss.`

`[Prechorus]`  
`Leaving right now,`  
`You keep the place.`  
`As I go out,`  
`Now, don’t you dare…`

`[Continued Prechorus]`  
`…wonder why now?`  
`When you know well…`  
`…what I’m about. No time to dwell.`

`[Chorus Outro]`  
`Marry the night, yeah, they told me it’s better.`  
`I’m my own guide, yeah, you screwed up forever.`  
`It’s additive; your excuses? Pathetic.`  
`I’m negative, you’re no longer magnetic.`

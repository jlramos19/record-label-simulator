**`You act childish by doing that, why do you share with the world how you feel about me? But then again, I wasn’t mad about it when it was good things. You made so many false promises and lied so much you seemed to start to believe them. I wish I could thank you for making me discern more, but you just made me more insecure`** 

**`It doesn’t make you want me more`**

**`I don’t know why I can’t ignore`**

**`The fact that we won’t find a cure`**

**`And I guess I could thank you for`**

**`Making me have to discern more`**

**`You know you made me insecure`**

**`No matter how much I implore`**

**`My pain won’t make you want me more`**

**`To you my chant is such a bore`**

**`But please, before you close the door`**

**`More, ignore, cure, for, insecure, implore, bore, etc.`**

\[Verse\]

Unlock the cell and let me out

I hope to tell you something now

I know it's hard to process this

But as my heart you've lost your grip

\[Pre-Chorus\]

Why do we still entertain this?

How much more can we contain this?

Where do you think this is going?

Can't you see what we've been knowing?

\[Chorus\]

I can't hear a thing

I am in a dream

I won't leave this bliss

I just want his kiss (kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss)

\[Verse\]

I hear the bells, and they're so loud

I bite my nails, you dance around

This sound's a bad thing we can't miss

Still as the heart, you've lost your grip

\[Pre-Chorus\]

Recklessness kills you in vain, miss

How long do you think we have here?

Where do you think this is going?

Can't you see what we've been showing?

\[Chorus\]

I can't hear a thing

I am in a dream

I won't leave this bliss

I just want his kiss (kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss)

\[Outro\]

Hi-his kiss (kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss)

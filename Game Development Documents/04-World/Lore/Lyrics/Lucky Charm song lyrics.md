`Lucky Charm`

`[First Verse]`  
`It’s such a skill, how all the pain you want to hide`  
`Just makes you chill, a lucky charm you keep inside`  
`That look could kill, but man I have already died`  
`Go back to -, and this time I’ll just step aside`

`[Second Verse]`  
`And if you will, man up and finally decide`  
`To pay the bill, for all the times that you have lied`  
`It’s not a drill, no matter how much more I cry`  
`I love you still, the only truth I can’t deny`

`[Third Verse]`  
`I take a pill, and see the pain just pass me by`  
`I’ll write the will a little later, don’t ask why`  
`Sometimes the thrill, comes not as much of a surprise`  
`You make me ill, manipulator in disguise`

`[Outro]`  
`So on a hill, my heart still beating for you dies`  
`At least until, I find another of those guys`

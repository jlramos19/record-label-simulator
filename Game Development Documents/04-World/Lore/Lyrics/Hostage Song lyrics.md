`Hostage`

`[Verse]`  
`Got us into a world`  
`You knew only one of us could leave`  
`When I was vulnerable`  
`You knew that you wanted me to grieve`  
`You forgot conveniently`  
`That I took it literally`

`[Pre-chorus]`  
`When you said we’d be together forever`  
`You knew you were ready to leave whenever`

`[Chorus]`  
`And what hurts is not the lie`  
`It’s that I don’t know if you lied`  
`It’s that you didn’t say what changed`  
`Before you forced us to bid farewell`

`[Verse]`  
`Got us into a void`  
`Inescapable but out of reach`  
`I felt insufferable`  
`You did not admit you had the key`  
`You forgot conveniently`  
`Treated me so differently`

`[Pre-chorus]`  
`You still said we’d be together forever`  
`Still knew you were ready to leave whenever`

`[Chorus]`  
`And what hurts is not the lie`  
`It’s that I don’t know if you lied`  
`It’s that you didn’t say what changed`  
`Before you forced us to bid farewell`

`[Bridge]`  
`If you knew it was over`  
`Why hold me hostage`  
`We were no longer lovers`  
`So why hold me hostage`

`If you knew it was over`  
`Why hold me hostage`  
`We were no longer lovers`  
`So why hold me hostage`

`[Outro]`  
`Let me leave`  
`You should too`  
`Let me leave`  
`You should too`  
`Let me leave`  
`You should too`  
`I feel dead`  
`Go ahead`

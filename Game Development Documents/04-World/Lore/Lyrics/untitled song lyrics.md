`I remember the first time I got high with you.`  
`The very first thing I saw was you.`  
`I remember telling you your head looked big,`  
`I didn’t mean it that way, I meant to say you looked really zoomed in and HD`

`Gotta love how I cried and now I feel better`  
`My emotions are gone, I can’t write you a letter`  
`I wish this deal was done, but you drag it forever`  
`I just love how you lied, though it’s not the first time`

`[Saddening Pre-Chorus about Loyalty]`  
`What do you want? What can I do?`  
`How do I help? I wave at you.`

`[Saddening Chorus about Loyalty]`  
`You make me feel empty when you disappear,`  
`And intoxicated without touching beer,`  
`I don’t know what struck you, it all seemed so fine,`  
`Or maybe I love you and want to be blind.`

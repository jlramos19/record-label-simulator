`[verse 1]`

`I can’t keep trying to fill a void`

`With you`

`I thought you told me you had enjoyed` 

`Me too`

`I wish I could have had held you more` 

`I do`

`Don’t really wanna go through that door`

`But I should`

`[pre-chorus]`

`I keep staring at my phone`

`Waiting for your call` 

`Get dry as a bone`

`Time to call Nicole`

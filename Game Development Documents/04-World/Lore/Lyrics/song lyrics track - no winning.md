I don’t want you to just let it slide  
Or to wonder if I’m on your side

Don’t you worry ‘bout knowing inside  
You know where this relationship died

And we both did it just out of spite

Who would think without you I would shine  
And I won’t think of calling you mine

In this war, there is no winning side

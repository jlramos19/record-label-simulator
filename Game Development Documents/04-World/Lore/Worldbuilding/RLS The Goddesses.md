# **The Goddesses of Gaia**

Within the mythology of Gaia, two sister deities embody the balance of peace and conflict: Lumiora, the Rose Goddess of the North, and Daethora, the Daisy Goddess of the South. Together, they represent the eternal cycle of harmony and turmoil that defines life in Annglora.

## **Lumiora — The Rose Goddess**

Lumiora rules over the northern forests and cultivated lands. Known as the bringer of serenity, she is depicted in a bioluminescent dress woven of roses, glowing in hues of pink and lavender. Her presence is associated with daylight, fertile landscapes, and the gentle power of renewal. Legends say she first taught mortals how to cultivate through song. Worshippers honor her at sunrise, singing hymns to ensure prosperity and stability. Her musical essence is echoed in harps and choirs.

## **Daethora — The Daisy Goddess**

Daethora reigns in the southern meadows at twilight. Unlike her sister, she embodies raw vitality and vengeance. Her daisy-patterned dress deceives with beauty while concealing chaos. Her power peaks at dusk, fading when Lumiora rises again. Followers invoke her with bonfires and daisy crowns, asking for strength and upheaval. Her music is heavy with drums and distorted strings, representing the chaos she controls. Myths tell of storms born from her footsteps and valleys split open in her rage.

## **Duality and Influence**

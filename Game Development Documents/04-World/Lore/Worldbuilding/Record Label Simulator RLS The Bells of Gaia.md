# **Record Label Simulator RLS — The Bells of Gaia**

In the mythology of Gaia, bells are sacred instruments believed to connect the mortal realm to the divine. Their resonance carries through the forests, meadows, and mountains of Annglora, bridging the voices of humanity with the ears of the goddesses Lumiora and Daethora.

## **Origins**

According to Anngloran myth, the first bell was forged to call upon Lumiora, the Rose Goddess, at sunrise. Its soft tones were said to awaken the earth with her serenity and ensure the fertility of the land. As twilight descended, bells tolled for Daethora, the Daisy Goddess, whose chaotic presence responded to urgent and louder strikes, believed to stir storms and summon upheaval.

## **Cultural Role**

• In the North, bells honor Lumiora in forests and fields at dawn, symbols of peace, renewal, and stability.  
• In the South, bells echo across meadows at dusk, dedicated to Daethora’s vitality and vengeance.  
• In Bytenza and Crowlya, festivals combine both traditions, ringing bells in cycles to symbolize the balance of day and night.

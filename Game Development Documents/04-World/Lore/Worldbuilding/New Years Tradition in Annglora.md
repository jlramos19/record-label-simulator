The tradition in Annglora is to give gifts to loved ones on New Year’s Eve to unwrap at midnight. 

The initial dialogue of the game (the tutorial) will have the uncle of the player (the player is the CEO and music executive of a “Record Label” (Record Label is record label)) welcoming the player to the player’s new Record Label and introducing him to everything. 

- HAPPY NEW YEARS\!

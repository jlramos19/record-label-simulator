## **Mood preference weights in Record Label Simulator: ANNGLoRA**

In Record Label Simulator, audiences do not score “emotions.” They score **Moods**, which are used (alongside Themes) to form **content Genres**.

### **Mood weights (1–10)**

* **uplifting:** 10  
* **calming:** 7.5  
* **cheering:** 6.66  
* **energizing:** 5  
* **saddening:** 3.33  
* **thrilling:** 2.5  
* **daring:** 2  
* **boring:** 1.5  
* **angering:** 1

### **Interpretation (Annglora culture → what content works)**

Annglora is culturally biased toward **Safe** content and tends to reward messaging aligned with **Freedom**.

Because of that, Annglora’s audience engages most with content that feels constructive, stable, and socially “clean.”

* **uplifting (10):** The highest-performing mood. Content that motivates, reassures, and builds collective positivity dominates charts and long-tail engagement.  
* **calming (7.5):** Strong second place. Content that soothes, restores, or provides harmony performs consistently.  
* **cheering (6.66):** Good performance. Crowd-ready positivity and celebratory tone work well, especially during high-visibility releases.  
* **energizing (5):** Mid-tier. Momentum and intensity can work, as long as it stays within a Safe-feeling frame.  
* **saddening (3.33):** Limited but real demand. Sadness is tolerated when it reads as healing or reflective rather than destructive.  
* **thrilling (2.5):** Low demand. Suspense and high-arousal mood can spike temporarily but is not culturally “default.”  
* **daring (2):** Very low demand. Risk-taking mood tends to underperform unless offset by a strong Safe theme/message.  
* **boring (1.5):** Poor performance. Low-arousal content that lacks payoff struggles to gain traction even when it’s “pleasant.”  
* **angering (1):** Lowest-performing mood. Content built around provocation, aggression, or rage is least aligned with Annglora’s cultural preference.

### **How this connects to content Genres**

A **content Genre** is formed by combining **one Theme \+ one Mood**, named like:  
**“theme but it’s mood”** (always lowercase).

So, in Annglora, content Genres that include **uplifting** or **calming** will generally outperform content Genres that include **angering** or **daring**, all else equal.

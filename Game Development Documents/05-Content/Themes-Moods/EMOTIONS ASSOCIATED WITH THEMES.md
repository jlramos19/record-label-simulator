   `- **FREEDOM (Cyan)**`
   `- **LOYALTY (Magenta)**`
   `- **AMBITION (Orange)**`
   `- **MORALITY (Dark Green)**`
   `- **POWER (Red)**`

   `- **FREEDOM (Blue)**`
   `- **LOYALTY (Red)**`
   `- **AMBITION (Yellow)**`
   `- **MORALITY (White)**`
   `- **POWER (Black)**`

`Green: FREEDOM (Blue) + AMBITION (Yellow)`
`Purple: FREEDOM (Blue) + LOYALTY (Red)`
`Orange: LOYALTY (Red) + AMBITION (Yellow)`

`2. **Emotions**: You have identified fifteen emotions, aiming to link each to the aforementioned themes both positively and negatively. The emotions include:`

`Calming 😌`

`Exciting 😆`

`Amusing 😄`

`Pleasing 😃`

`Gratifying 🥹`

`Satisfying ☺️`

`Surprising 😮`

`Pending Task: Finalize the combination of themes/Themes with positive and negative emotions.`

`3. **In-game Mechanism**: The unique mechanism of your game allows the CEO (player) to recharge by engaging in activities aligned with their Themes. This adds depth and complexity to the gameplay experience, as maintaining these Themes and balancing them will be key.`

   `- **Example**: For "AMBITION (Orange)", the player might engage in learning new industry trends (recharging activity), which rewards them with a sense of FREEDOM (positive emotion), but also could stir feelings of fear or unease (negative emotion) due to the challenges ahead.`

`While we're yet to assign definite emotions to Themes/themes, we already have the building blocks to link your themes, emotions, and in-game activities in a coherent, engaging, and meaningful way.`

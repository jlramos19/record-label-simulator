## **`Mood preference weights in Record Label Simulator: BYTENZA`**

`In Record Label Simulator, audiences do not score “emotions.” They score Moods, which are used (alongside Themes) to form content Genres (Theme + Mood).`

`Bytenza’s cultural bias favors Neutral alignment and tends to reward content that reads as ambitious, balanced, and strategically framed rather than purely “safe” or purely “risky.”`

### **`Mood weights (1–10)`**

* **`energizing:`** `10`  
* **`thrilling:`** `7.5`  
* **`daring:`** `6.66`  
* **`cheering:`** `6`  
* **`uplifting:`** `5`  
* **`angering:`** `4`  
* **`calming:`** `3.33`  
* **`saddening:`** `2.5`  
* **`boring:`** `1`

### **`Interpretation (Bytenza culture → what content works)`**

* **`energizing (10):`** `Bytenza responds best to forward motion: hustle, ambition, momentum, “we’re building something.” This pairs naturally with Bytenza’s Neutral + Ambition bias.`

* **`thrilling (7.5):`** `Strong appetite for stakes and tension—as long as it stays “strategic” rather than chaotic.`  
* **`daring (6.66):`** `Risk is welcomed when it feels calculated. (Not reckless; deliberate.) This keeps it Neutral, not Crowlya-level Risky.`

* **`cheering (6):`** `Works when it reads as confidence and win-energy, not naïve joy.`  
* **`uplifting (5):`** `Solid baseline for mass reach, especially when framed as self-improvement or achievement.`  
* **`angering (4):`** `Exists as fuel (defiance, rivalry, “prove them wrong”), but it’s not the core Bytenza mood.`  
* **`calming (3.33):`** `Underperforms unless paired with an Ambition theme (focus/discipline vibe rather than softness).`  
* **`saddening (2.5):`** `Low demand; sadness tends to be seen as loss of momentum in this market.`  
* **`boring (1):`** `Lowest-performing mood.`

### **`How this connects to content Genres`**

`A content Genre is formed by combining one Theme + one Mood. Bytenza tends to reward content Genres that align with Neutral + Ambition, such as Ambition paired with Energizing or Thrilling.`

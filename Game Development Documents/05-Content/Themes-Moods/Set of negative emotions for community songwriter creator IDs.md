That’s a very interesting approach\! In your game, each songwriter creator ID will start with a set of three negative emotions. The goal is to transform these negative emotions into positive ones, which can be done by first turning them into neutral emotions and then into positive ones. If a negative emotion doesn’t have a corresponding neutral or positive emotion, then the emotion is simply diffused once it’s used as inspiration for lead sheets.

For example, if a songwriter has the emotions “sad”, “angry”, and “disgusted”, you would assign a theme (a drive of the CEO) to explore these negative emotions and turn them into positive ones. This could involve creating lead sheets that reflect these emotions and their transformation.

All community ID songwriters will be teenagers aged 13-19. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the game, as managing young talent can present unique challenges and opportunities.

This setup provides a dynamic and nuanced framework for evaluating the performance of your songwriter IDs. It encourages emotional exploration and transformation, which can lead to a more engaging and challenging gameplay experience. 😊

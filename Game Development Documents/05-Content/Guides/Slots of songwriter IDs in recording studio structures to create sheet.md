`Here are the calculations for the time per sheet music and the number of sheet music pieces produced based on the number of Songwriter IDs, with the time decreasing by 12 minutes for each additional ID and looping back to 60 minutes:`

`- 1 Songwriter ID: 60 mins / sheet music (1 piece)`  
`- 2 Songwriter IDs: 48 mins / sheet music (1 piece)`  
`- 3 Songwriter IDs: 36 mins / sheet music (1 piece)`  
`- 4 Songwriter IDs: 24 mins / sheet music (1 piece)`  
`- 5 Songwriter IDs: 12 mins / sheet music (1 piece)`  
`- 6 Songwriter IDs: 60 mins / sheet music (2 pieces)`  
`- 7 Songwriter IDs: 48 mins / sheet music (2 pieces)`  
`- 8 Songwriter IDs: 36 mins / sheet music (2 pieces)`  
`- 9 Songwriter IDs: 24 mins / sheet music (2 pieces)`  
`- 10 Songwriter IDs: 12 mins / sheet music (2 pieces)`  
`- 11 Songwriter IDs: 60 mins / sheet music (3 pieces)`  
`- 12 Songwriter IDs: 48 mins / sheet music (3 pieces)`  
`- 13 Songwriter IDs: 36 mins / sheet music (3 pieces)`  
`- 14 Songwriter IDs: 24 mins / sheet music (3 pieces)`  
`- 15 Songwriter IDs: 12 mins / sheet music (3 pieces)`

`This way, the calculation properly loops back to 60 minutes after reducing to 0, and the number of sheet music pieces produced increases accordingly.`

`Here are the calculations for the time per demo recording and the number of demo recordings produced based on the number of Recorder IDs, with the time decreasing by 24 minutes for each additional ID and capping at 10 slots:`

`- 1 Recorder ID: 120 mins / demo recording (1 piece)`  
`- 2 Recorder IDs: 96 mins / demo recording (1 piece)`  
`- 3 Recorder IDs: 72 mins / demo recording (1 piece)`  
`- 4 Recorder IDs: 48 mins / demo recording (1 piece)`  
`- 5 Recorder IDs: 24 mins / demo recording (1 piece)`  
`- 6 Recorder IDs: 120 mins / demo recording (2 pieces)`  
`- 7 Recorder IDs: 96 mins / demo recording (2 pieces)`  
`- 8 Recorder IDs: 72 mins / demo recording (2 pieces)`  
`- 9 Recorder IDs: 48 mins / demo recording (2 pieces)`  
`- 10 Recorder IDs: 24 mins / demo recording (2 pieces)`

`This ensures that the demo recordings are produced efficiently based on the number of Recorder IDs with a 24-minute reduction per additional ID. Let me know if you need similar calculations for Producers or any other adjustments.`

`Here are the calculations for the time per track and the number of tracks produced based on the number of Producer IDs, with the time decreasing by 36 minutes for each additional ID and capping at 5 slots:`

`- 1 Producer ID: 180 mins / track (1 piece)`  
`- 2 Producer IDs: 144 mins / track (1 piece)`  
`- 3 Producer IDs: 108 mins / track (1 piece)`  
`- 4 Producer IDs: 72 mins / track (1 piece)`  
`- 5 Producer IDs: 36 mins / track (1 piece)`

`This ensures that the tracks are produced efficiently based on the number of Producer IDs with a 36-minute reduction per additional ID. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust or calculate!`
